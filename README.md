# Haxe.io

The new home of the Haxe Roundups.

## Contributing...

### to the Haxe Roundups

If you have an link you would like to be included in the the next
roundup and it was published since the last roundup was released, you
can add it to the latest issue, named `Haxe Roundup ###` where `###` is
the next roundup issue number.

The link should include, the link url, _pretty obvious_, and if possible, 
the authors social handle. Any social account can be used.

### an article

If you have tips, tricks, ideas, or techniques to contribute to Haxe.io,
then you're more than welcome to help provide others with solid and useful
articles. Just fork the repository and add your article to the `articles` 
folder.

The file format should be markdown, but if you can justify your reason
for using a different format, go for it.

### your personal opinion (_related to the Haxe ecosystem_)

You're more than welcome to write about your personal opinion. Just fork the
repository and create a folder using your name or a social handle, prefixed
with `@`. Eg `@skial`. Then create a markdown file and get writing.

I'm fine with cross site publishing and do **not** personally attack anyone. It
won't be accepted.

### to the site

The site is tricky to get setup locally, I am working on making it easier. For those
that feel brave, you can follow the [Installation and Setup][wiki 1] guide.

Don't hesitate to file a new [issue] or join in on an existing [issue].

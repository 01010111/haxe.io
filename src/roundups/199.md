# Haxe Roundup № 199

[Haxor] the HTML5 and WebGL engine has been released, currently as a direct 
[download][l1], Haxor _“combines the power of [the] Haxe language, HTML5 [and] 
WebGL to easily develop powerful applications that can run in any modern browser”_.

To find out more about what Haxor supports and can provide check out the recently
launched [website][l2] and the all the [examples][l3].

[Vadim] has pushed a bunch of updates to [HaxMin], the Haxe powered Javascript obfuscator
which is compatible with Haxe's `Reflect`, which is now 5-6 times faster.

[Andy Li] has made [jQueryExtern] compatible with jQuery `1.11.1` and `2.1.1`. If you
do have to use jQuery, I would recommend using these externs instead of the one included
in the Haxe standard library.

[Chronosyndrome] has started to learn OpenGL by using Haxe and [Lime]. He has decided
to write short and simple tutorials as he progresses. He has already written 
[Day 0, Hello Lime][l4] and [Day 1, Let's draw some triangles!][l5]. I expect this is
going to great series of tutorials.

[Sean O'Dowd] has written [Flambe is awesome][l6]. He compares Flambe packaged with
Adobe Air with a Unity3D build showing 500 animated sprites performs better with the
Flambe build, but if you need 2k+ animated sprites, Unity wins. Sean restates what
[Aymeric] said [last week][l7], that Flambe just runs at a solid 60fps on iOS and
Android with any effort.

[Allan Dowdeswell] has tweeted a project he recently finished called [Lentil Hunter][l8]
which is a HTML5/Flash hybrid interactive map built using Haxe.

HaxeFlixel `3.3.2` and `3.3.3` have been released, fixing Xbox gamepad support, loads
of `Flx*` fixes and [more][l9].

[Christopher Kaster] has created [HaxeFlixel Game Mechanic Explorer][l11] which is
a _“collection of concrete examples for various game mechanics, algorithms and 
effects.”_ This is a port of the original [Game Mechanic Explorer][l10] by 
[John Watson].

There is another Kickstarter game being built using HaxeFlixel, [Animal Album][l12]
which is a _“Pokémon style RPG with real animals and without the fighting. Tells of
nature, technology, a little sadness and a lot of kindness”_.

Another HaxeFlixel game is [Times Ninja Adventure][l14], available on iOS and Android.
_“Times Ninja Adventure is a new unique way to learn the Times Table. We tried to 
make it as fun as possible, especially for boys that do not have the patience 
to sit for long hours and memorize something”_.

One more game, this time on Steam Greenlight, built using Stencyl, which uses Haxe 
and OpenFL is [Ghost Song][l13]. Ghost Song is a _“2D action platformer set in an
open world”_.

How about 79 more games made using Haxe, OpenFL, HaxeFlixel, HaxePunk, Flambe and
Stencyl all made during LD29. Checkout the [Haxe LD29 Roundup][l19].

[HIDE][l24] `0.3.9` will [feature][l17] annotation ruler, outline 
panel and  function hinting.

![hide hint](/img/hide-function-hint.gif "HIDE 0.3.9 Function Hint")

[Pah Arif] has released three videos demonstrating Haxe Studio on [OSX][l22], 
[New Project][l15] and [Open Project and Autocompletion][l16] features of 
Haxe Studio, a fork of HIDE. If you're interested in getting updates on the
development of Haxe Studio head over to their [Google+][l23] profile.

[Philippe Elsass] has written a [friendly tip][l18] to the Haxe community and all
the other communities out there. Read it all.

![flashdevelop python](/img/flashdevelop-python.png "FlashDevelop Compiling Haxe to Python!")

[Matt Johnson] has released [Haxe Flurry] which is a Flurry Analytics library for
Haxe. It currently only supports iOS.

[Here][l20] is a snippet by [Dan Korostelev] showing how to use `abstracts` on optional
structure fields in a type safe way.

And to finish up check out this sneak peek [video][l21] by [Michel Käser] which shows what could
be a evented server written in Haxe, possibly in the style of NodeJS?

# Haxe Roundup № 209

[Taigolr][tw1] has created and released _another_ library, [Assets Manager], which
_“provides utilities to manage external file”_. Manage meaning queue, load and save 
files using _“relative, absolute paths or urls [and] receive alerts for modified
files or folders”_.

[Vadim][tw2] has written [OpenFL Bitfive now supports multi touch][l1], which is an
alternative OpenFL HTML5 backend, supports identical Flash `TouchEvent` objects, 
as the _“events are routed automatically and you don't need to worry about browsers
and devices with partial or glitchy support”_. Vadim has also added the ability to have
mouse events converted to touch events to ease testing with the `bitfive_mouseTouches`
flag. In his [post][l1] Vadim goes into more detail on the inner working of bitfives
event handling and some subtle differences. You should also support Vadim through his
[Patreon][l2] page.

[Codir][tw3] has released a video, below, of his game Dungeon of Gain.

At this years WWX 2014 conference, [Todd Kulick][tw4] talked about _“shipping one million
lines of Haxe to over one million devices”_. TiVo have [actually][l3] begun updating the
Roamio, Premiere and Mini boxes with the _summer update_. Checkout the new features 
below, because of Haxe.

[Sam MacPherson][tw5] has posted to the Haxe mailing list that he has create [Haxe OAuth]
which is an OAuth 1 and OAuth 2 cross platform implementation.

[David Elahee][tw6] from Motion-Twin has updated his article [Debugging haxe/cpp 
executables with visual studio][l4]. 

[Tomek][tw7] has been actively working on [weblog] which is a _“Haxe remote debugging
tool”_ which logs messages, has object inspection and real time stats like FPS and memory.
From my quick look I'm assuming it can accept logs and stats from any compile target,
which is awesome.

[Andreas Rønning][tw8] has written two articles [From Flash to GPU: History and preface][l5]
and [From Flash to GPU: Clients and servers][l6] which are _“a simpletons introduction
to rendering with OpenGL and Stage3D written with Flash developers in mind”_. And if 
you feel like commenting about these, head over to Andreas's Google+ [post][l7] which
has a conversation already started.

[Laurent Bédubourg][tw9] has published [How to use LibGDX with Haxe Part 2][l8] which
is the follow up to, you guessed it, [How to use LibGDX with Haxe Part 1][l9] in
last weeks [roundup][l10].

Another follow on from last week, [Steve Richey][tw10] shows us the start animation for
Drill Bunny.

[Ben Morris][tw11] has updated [hxpk], which is a Haxe port of the LibGDX texture packer,
with the ability to runtime packing with OpenFL embedded assets.

Cadet Editor, the extensible editor framework for Flash, has been made [open source][l11]
and have made a start on a Haxe port.

Another editor, Reach3dx, have [launched][l12] their brand new website and are currently
looking for people try the beta version, limited to 200 people. Reach3dx is built on
Haxe and OpenFL which offers a _“a new full-featured 3D game engine which provides 
cross platform support for mobile and web platforms”_.

[Beware Entertainment][tw12] have released [Stratega][l13] onto Armor Games. Stratega
_“puts your strategic and defense skills to test in this fast paced real time strategy
game with an addictive combination of TD”_.

Alot of these games would not have been possible without HaxelFlixel, which so happens
to have released version `3.3.5` to [haxelib][l14].

And to finish off, how about a Windows 95 [emulator] made with Haxe and StablexUI by
[Smoke Fumus][tw13].

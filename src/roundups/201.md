# Haxe Roundup № 201

With the [WWX 2014] conference almost upon us, starting this Friday, how about getting to
know some of the speakers? Checkout the following speaker interviews for more information
on what impresses and inspires them, their opinions on the future of Haxe and OpenFL
and a little more detail about their upcoming talks.

1. [Hugh Sanderson]
2. [Andreas Soderlund]
3. [Franco Ponticelli]
4. [Caue Wanecks]
5. [Justin Donaldson]
6. [Elliott Stoneham]
7. [Juraj Kirchheim]

Hilgard Bell who is part of team [Clockwork Acorn][tw1] has written the article [How we
came to use OpenFL][a1] for their latest game [Monsters and Medicine][l1] in which
he says how OpenFL is the closest thing to being the _“holy grail”_.

[Jacob Albano][tw2] has put his game [Iridescence][l2], a mind bending puzzle game
about discovery, made with HaxeFlixel, has been released onto itch.io.

Talking of HaxeFlixel, [sruloart][g1] has created a list of [resources for HaxeFlixel][l3]
which is huge, covering device targets, examples, native extensions, api extensions,
libraries and loads more. Even with all the info it has, its classed as not complete...

[IceEntity][l4], a simple framework for managing entities and components in HaxeFlixel
has been updated with an [entity parser][l5] allowing you to create entities from xml
files.

[Steve Richey][l10] has created [January][l11], a generative music tool, which is a 
port of the original January created by [Richard Vreeland][l12].

Oh and HaxeFlixel have become the [most stared][l6] Haxe repository on github with 500
plus stars.

Take a look at this [demo][d1] of deferred lighting created with the latest build of 
[Genome2D] shown in the first Genome2D DevCast.

I expect [Game Console] version `3.0` would run perfectly in any Haxe program and not
be limited some how to a game framework. Game Console allows you to, in real time, view
and edit variables, monitor variables and methods. It also comes with its own light 
weight profiler. Amazing work.

[Haxe UI] has received a lot of praise this last week from a few of the WWX 2014
speakers who have been interviewed and for good reasons, it's an impressive project.
Checkout the updated [showcase][l7] page.

[Kyle Travis][tw3] has written the article [Haxe Signals][l8] in which he shares his
signal manager class and some usage examples.

[Christopher Kaster][g2] has updated [highlight.js][l9] by adding basic Haxe support to
the list of what it can highlight.

And to finish off, if you work with anonymous structures but you want to use them
like a normal `Map`, then read [Daniel Korostelev's][tw4] article [Working with Dynamic
anonymous structures in a type safe way][l13].

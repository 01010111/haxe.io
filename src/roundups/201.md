There are a couple more speaker interviews still to be released.

Hilgard Bell, part of the team [Clockwork Acorn][tw1] has written the article [How we
came to use OpenFL][a1] for their latest game [Monsters and Medicine][l1], on how
OpenFL is the closest thing to being the “holy grail”.

[Jacob Albano][tw2] has put his game [Iridescence][l2] is a mind bending puzzle game
about discovery which is made with HaxeFlixel has been release onto itch.io.

Talking of HaxeFlixel, [sruloart][g1] has created a list of [resouces for HaxeFlixel][l3]
which is huge, covering device targets, examples, native extensions, api extensions,
libraries and loads more. Even with all the info it has, its not even complete...

[IceEntity][l4], a simple framework for managing entities and components in HaxeFlixel
has been updated with an [entity parser][l5] allowing you to create entities from xml
files.

Oh and HaxeFlixel have become the [most stared][l6] Haxe repository on github with 500+
stars.

Take a look at this [demo][d1] of deferred lighting created with the latest build of 
[Genome2D] in the first Genome2D DevCast.

I expect [Game Console] version `3.0` would run perfectly in any Haxe program and not
being limited some how to a game framework, because it allows you to in real time view
and edit variables, monitor variables and methods and comes with its own light weight
profiler. It sounds amazing, how am I only finding out about it now!?

[Haxe UI] which has gotten alot of praise this last week from afew of the WWX 2014
speakers who have been interview, has updated its [showcase][l7] page.

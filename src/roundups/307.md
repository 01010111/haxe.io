# Haxe Roundup № 307

![wwx 2015 social](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

The next Haxe release, version `3.2` is fast [approaching][l1], with the latest _major_
change being merged, a cross-platform [typed array][l2] implementation which follows
the Javascript spec which _“describes an array-like view of an underlying 
binary data buffer”_. You can test it out via [builds.haxe.org][l3].

New versions of Lime and OpenFL have been released, `2.1.1` and `2.2.6` respectively.
Lime has added initial Emscripten support, allowing you to compile native code into
optimised Javascript, asm.js, which gets a performance boost in Firefox since version
`22`.

[Seven2 Interactive][l4] are looking to [hire][l5] a game developer, with 
experience using Flambé, _“creating games, digital experiences and online 
advertisement campaigns for big clients like Nickelodeon, Mattel, AT&T and Disney”_.
Seven2 are located in Spokane, Washington, USA, where you must be willing to relocate.

[Franco Ponticelli][tw1] has released his entity library, [Edge][l6] to [haxelib][l7]
which utilises build macros to grant your components and systems special powers.

Not content with one new library this week, Franco has also released his
experimental library [Restx][l8], which helps you _“build REST apis with 
Haxe, [Express] and NodeJS”_. You can see an early minimalistic [web server][l9] using
Restx.

[Matthijs Kamstra][tw2] has written the [article][l10] Tween Engine Go Part 2 in
which Matthijs compares Go to Actuate over on his updated [promotional][l11] site.

Also checkout the [post][l12] Pixel Sprite Generator Editor in which Matthijs creates
an editor which creates pixel spaceships, using OpenFL, [Pixel Sprite Generator][l14]
and [MinimalCompsHX][l13].

The OpenFL team have spoken with Nilsen Filc, CEO of [Puzzl][tw3], who created
Yummy Circus, the _“colourful massively cross-platform puzzle game”_ in their
latest [Developer Spotlight][l15] which are always a great read.

[Sven Bergström][tw4] creator of flõw, snõw, luxe and [other][l16] libraries under
the Snõwkit collective has [written][l17] Using the Android x86 Emulator for testing
from flõw.

Here is a game created with luxe, snõw and flõw, [Baby Touch Tones][l18] by
[Jonathan Hirz][tw5], a _“fun, bright, musical toy for your young ones. Touch 
and interact with four different instruments in ascending tones. Fun sparkles 
flow from each touch as your child interacts with this toy”_.

Head over to Jonathan's blog to read the short announcement [post][l19] for
Baby Touch Tones on how he started out, where he got his inspiration from and more.

[Paco Barter][tw6] has released [Stacker2][l20] via Google Play Store which was made
with HaxeFlixel. In Stacker2 you need to _“make clever decisions and let the tiles
fall to their best locations to maximize the score”_.

And to finish off this weeks roundup, Daktylos by [Sempai Games][tw7] created with 
OpenFL which was released onto Android [five weeks][l21] ago, has been released
for [iOS][l22]. In Daktylos you _“help Daktylos, the last of his species, to 
survive in the prehistoric world full of dangers and enemies”_.

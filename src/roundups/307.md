# Haxe Roundup № 307

![wwx 2015 social](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

The next Haxe release, version `3.2` is fast [approaching][l1], with the latest _major_
change being merged, a cross-platform [typed array][l2] implementation which follows
the Javascript spec which _“describes an array-like view of an underlying 
binary data buffer”_. You can test it out via [builds.haxe.org][l3].

New versions of Lime and OpenFL have been released, `2.1.1` and `2.2.6` respectivily.
Lime has added initial Emscripten support, allowing you to compile native code into
optimised Javascript, asm.js, which gets a performance boost in Firefox since version
`22`.

[Seven2 Interactive][l4] are looking to [hire][l5] a Haxe game developer, with 
experience using Flambé, _“creating games, digital experiences and online 
advertisement campaigns for big clients like Nickelodeon, Mattel, AT&T and Disney”_.
Seven2 are located in Spokane, Washington, USA and you must be willing to relocate.

[Franco Ponticelli][tw1] has released his entity library, [Edge][l6] to [haxelib][l7]
which utilises build macros to grant your components and systems special powers.

Not content with one new library this week, Franco has also released his
experiemental library[Restx][l8], which helps you _“Build REST apis with 
Haxe, [Express] and NodeJS”_. You can see an early minimalistic [web server][l9] using
Restx.

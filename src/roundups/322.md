# Haxe Roundup № 322

A Haxe ChromeCast multiplayer game created by [Media Monks][tw1] has been
featured at Google IO 2015!

There have been **two** OpenFL live coding previews released over the last week.

The first from [Dima Granetchi][gh1] called [halk2][l1] who [README][l2] explains
how to get it working.

The second is from [Thomas Baudon][tw2] who has released a preview of live coding
with OpenFL on PC and Android. I'm unsure if this is open source or not.

[Diego Machado][tw3] has [published][l3] the HaxeFlixel Resources which contains a
_“compilation of tips, tricks, snippets and tutorials”_.

Diego can add another tutorial to his resource list, [this one][l4] on Camera Zoom
written by [Leong Wai Yin][tw4]. As usual Leong has done a great job.

[Lubos Lenco][tw5] has released **another** [demo][l5] using ZBlender, his game
3D game engine which integrates the Kha framework with Blender, which demonstrates
world exploration in third person.

[Jonathan Hirz][tw6] has published the Prototypes [article][l6] in which he shares
five prototypes all built using luxe engine. _“I’m sure this is something all 
makers can relate to… I have too many prototypes floating around!”_

[Haxor Engine][tw7], the WebGL engine, has made it onto The Big List of HTML5 3D
Games Engines [article][l7]

# Haxe Roundup № 194

Today is the last day to support Haxe, OpenFL, FlashDevelop and RenPy in this weeks
[Humble Bundle Weekly Sale](https://www.humblebundle.com/weekly) celebrating open
source!

The Haxe team have [released][a 5] Haxe `3.1.2` which introduces bug fixes, 
optimizations and two small new additions.

[Eduardo Pons][tw 1] has tweeted a preview WebGL [demo][d 1] of his up and coming, soon
to be announced Haxe WebGL engine Haxor. The demo shows off GPU particles, lighting with
the level created in 3DS Max. Cycling through keys `1-5` displays different gizmos and
using `space` makes the knight attack which has sound sync to the animation. The sound is
a little quiet but its there. 

Some people have found that the demo runs slow in Firefox, but considering this is only
an initial demo of whats to come, its impressive.

[Monster Face Games][tw 2] have a technical write up on [developing a cross platform game
with Haxe, OpenFL and HaxePunk][a 1] in which Ben talks about the development, prototyping,
the easy of OpenFL and HaxePunk and the small differences he faced when compiling Gorilla
Defense cross-platform.

If you or others are not impressed by the easy of development Haxe offers, how
about reading what [Mark Knol][tw 4] noticed while creating his first [very own][a 6] game 
by using Flambe to target HTML5 and Flash, using WebGL with a Canvas fallback and Stage3D,
respectively. By using the Flash build with Adobe AIR to compile the Android and iOS versions,
Mark has targeted four different platforms without writing any platform or device specific code.

So if reading about Flambe has sparked some excitement in you, how about checking out
[Jeremy McCurdy's][tw 5] video [Getting started with Flambe][v 1].

[Allan Dowdeswell][tw 3] has written the article [Adobe: Why no AS3/HTML5 solution for Flash?][a 2]
in which he criticises Adobe for not using an open source solution, _Haxe_, to enable Actionscript to
Javascript compiles in the IDE.

[FlashDevelop][tw 6] version `4.6.0` has been released with loads of Haxe [improvements][a 3]!

[Damjan Cvetko][tw 7] has updated the article [How to test FlashDevelop HxCppDebugger][a 4] again.
Remember its only for the brave.

[Cauê Waneck][tw 8] has written a toy/real [REPL for Haxe](https://gist.github.com/waneck/9806641). 
Because he [couldn't](https://twitter.com/cwaneck/status/449165354951254016) sleep.
	
And to finish up, [Sam MacPherson][tw 9] has released [js2hx] which can convert JSDoc annotated 
Javascript to Haxe externs. Unfortunately it is not a general javascript converter, it was built
specifically to build externs for the Phaser library which you can find at [PhaserHaxe][g 1]. So its
still awesome.

# Haxe Roundup № 300

![social neo scavenger](/img/300/neo.png "NEO Scavenger by @dcfedor")

[NEO Scavenger][l1], a _“game where you must survive in the wasteland long enough to 
figure out who you are”_ created by [Daniel Fedor][tw1] using Haxe and OpenFL for it's
editing tools has received great reviews. As of today, NEO Scavenger is the 
number one selling game on GOG.com and has been for the [last few][l2] days.

Another recently released game available on Steam is [Redux: Dark Matters][l3] by
[Robert Konrad][tw2] from KTX Software in _“beautiful super sharp 1080p”_. Even 
though the game might not be made with Haxe, its made with Kore which the Kha 
framework uses to power its native targets.

The game releases continue with [Greg Caldwell's][tw3] first game created with Haxe
and OpenFL, Window Cleaner available from the [Google Play Store][l4] and the [App
Store][l5]. From Greg's [website][l6] the game has _“Game Centre / Google Play 
Services leaderboards [and] Admob / iAd advertising”_.

The latest [Sushi Cat][l7] game by [Jay Armstrong][tw4], Sushi Cat-a-pult, was made
with Haxe and OpenFL and published to Armor Games. The cute art is by [Jimp][tw5].

The only Christmas themed game to be released is [Lego Wow][l8] by [Media Monks][tw6] 
who used Haxe and Flambe to create the game.

A game from LD31, [Samuel Bouchet][tw7] who created [C.O.S.M.M.O.S][l9] has written
about [creating a MMO in 72 hours][l10], the architecture overview, client and server
communication, cheat prevention and more. It's an interesting read on using
Haxe and OpenFL targeting Flash and Neko, for client and server, respectively.

With the recent release of Papers, Please to the [App Store][l11] and all it's _troubles_
with the approval process you can read about the situation in an [interview][l12] with
Lucas Pope.

And if you have been thinking of creating games for the first time, [David Elahee][tw8]
has written down his [advice][l13] and distilled it into ten points.

![concept art](/img/300/concept.jpg "Concept art from @CreativeMageEnt upcoming space game")

[Elias Ku][tw9] has created a new mid level GPU framework called [horror][l14], 
which is built in a unified way ontop of snow, lime and/or OpenFL. This means your
able to target any platform supported by the low level framework. Horror only runs
on Stage3D, WebGL, GL, GLES platforms and uses the fastest memory API available on
each target.

[Lubos Lenco][tw10] continues to port and build libraries which support the Kha
framework. This week he has updated [dragon bones][l15] to support the Kha framework.

Another library which has been updated is [jQuery Extern][l16] by [Andy Li][gh1].
If you need jQuery in your projects, I recommend these externs over the ones
included in the standard library. Andy has update the externs to support jQuery
`1.11.2` / `2.1.3`.

You might have come across the [What colour is it?][l17] site, which changes its
background based on the time. [Erik Watson][tw10] has created a port called
[Colour Clock][l18] which includes two methods for determining the colour, one which
mimics _What colour is it?_ and an _“Improved one that aims to represent more of 
the colour spectrum”_.

Shuffling pixel art by [Nico][tw12] using luxe engine.

[Chuck Batson][gh2] has contributed an awesome library to the Haxe community, 
[HxBitcoin][l19]! Chuck has posted a quick [introduction][l20] article and
an article on how the [GCC compiler broke HXCPP][l21]. hxBitcoin doesn't just bring
Bitcoin to Haxe, but all the necessary cryptocurrency and cryptography implementations
needed for Bitcoin to work, backed by 22K plus individual tests which successfully pass on
all supported targets and platforms.

A library I've just discovered is [Geom Algo][l22] by [Giuseppe Di Mauro][gh3]. 
Geom Algo brings to the community a _“small collection of geometry algorithms 
in [pure] Haxe”_.

I'll finish this weeks roundup off with the [post][l23] _Haxe performance study: 
Loop-invariant code motion_ by [Jason Sturges][tw11]. Jason continues to show
us which method is the fastest across compile targets and platforms.

**Have a Merry Christmas everyone!**

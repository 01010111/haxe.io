# Haxe Roundup № 216

I have published two articles this week, the first being [The Haxe Ludum Dare 30
Roundup][l1] which features over 85 games using [Haxe][l2], [Kha][l3], [Flambe][l4],
[OpenFL][l5], [HaxePunk][l6], [HaxeFlixel][l7] and [Stencyl][l8]. The OpenFL library
is used in about 86% of the games and HaxeFlixel being the most popular high 
level framework in use.

The second article published this week is the video tutorial series, [The Nature of
Haxe and OpenFL][l9] created by [Christopher Bulter][tw1] which is based on the the
book [The Nature of Code][l10] written by [Daniel Shiffman][tw2] which originally
uses the Processing language.

[Lubos Lenco][tw3] previews using Blender as a 3D editor for Haxe and the Kha framework.

[Franco Ponticelli][tw4] has released [thx.unit][l11] which contains abstract classes 
for various kinds of units which can automatically convert between any other one of
the 100+ units in the library.

[Franco][tw4] has also re-implemented and re-released [thx.color][l12] which is a
general purpose colour library for Haxe. Franco makes use of abstracts which
allow you to use `String` or `Int` when representing a colour.

[Nico][tw5] has created a dark, minimal theme for FlashDevelop, named [Sliderock][l13].

I found the [Cartography Coordinate Tools][l14] library through this [gist][l15], both
created by the [MadeByPi][tw6] agency. The [library][l14] _“provides calculators and 
conversion tools for earthly coordinate systems”_.

A while ago [Media Monks][tw7] released their latest mobile game Guerlain, built
with Haxe and Flambe. [Mark Knol][tw8] has written [Guerlain - A Mobile Platformer 
Game][l16] which gives you a general overview of how the game was created.

And to finish this weeks roundup off, [Jacob Albano][tw9] has announced that his
game [Iridescence][l17] will be launching soon on all desktop platforms 
simultaneously.

# Haxe Roundup № 225

[Daniel Glazman][tw1] has written [Announcing Quaxe][l1], a pure Haxe DOM and
CSS implementation allowing which will allow native desktop and mobile applications
using native UI using HTML5 compiled with Haxe.

You can stay up todate with the development of Quaxe at its [official][l2] site, where
you can see that Daniel has implemented full support for Level 3 and partial
Level 4 CSS selectors.

A library which already provides a cross-platform UI library, [StablexUI][l3], has
released version `1.1.0` which introduces [custom theme][l4] support and many
other improvements by [Alexander Kuzmenko][tw2].

Back in [roundup][l5] № 223, [Pah Arif][tw3] demoed a cross-platform real time
debugger, this week is [Jeff Ward's][tw4] turn demoing [hxScout][l6], a cross-platform
alternative to Adobe Scout.

If you want to keep track of crash data that your app generates, take a look at
[Crash Dumper][l7], _“a cross-platform automated crash report generator/sender”_.
[Lars Doucet][tw5] recently commissioned [Adam Perry][tw6] to create 
[Crash Dump Browser][l8] which is the recommended backend to use with Crash Dumper.

[Adi Reddy Mora][s1] has released three extern JavaScript libraries, [pixi.js][l9],
[howler.js][l10] and [buzz][l11]. Not content on creating three extern libraries,
Adi has written [Haxe 'never' and 'inline' keywords][l12] which explains how to
get `const` behaviour in Haxe.

While we are on the topic of tutorials, [Andrew Lion][tw7] has written
[Parsing JSON with Haxe][l13] which shows you how to parse JSON and stringify
values, but also demonstrates how to strictly type your JSON.

Another tutorial is [Creating a simple particle generator][l14] by [Xenizo Games][tw8]
using [Barrage][l15], a bullet scripting library, to help generate bullet patterns.
The article goes into detail with plenty of examples, all of which are well
described.

Currently the master of creating Haxe tutorials is [Kirill Poletaev][tw9] who 
continues to write HaxeUI [tutorials][l16], ranging from using XML layouts, to 
creating Popups and Styling your UI elements.

[Lubos Lenco][tw17] has created a [demo][l29] which was created using Blender using Kha
running on WebGL.

The OpenFL team have [announced][l17] that they are migrating to a new community
forum which will try to bring some of the value from OpenFL's Slack chat
to the forum.

Also checkout the [Developer Spotlight of Danny Yaroslavski][l18] the creator of
Lightbot, a set of games that teach kids coding logic.

An OpenFL library by [Kevin Leung][gh1], called [zbar][l19], is a _“native 
extension for OpenFL which features a non-fullscreen barcode scanner”_.

If you don't want to use Microsoft Visual Studio to compile your HXCPP apps, you
now have the option of using MinGW, by using the [minimingw][l20] library provided by
[Hugh Sanderson][tw10].

![soil snowkit](/img/225/soil.png "@JustSuds progress on Soil using snõwkit and Haxe")

A couple of games have been released.

[Jakob Kuen][tw11] has made BrakeBlock available on [iOS][l21] and
[Android][l22]. BrakeBlock is created with OpenFL and _“features simplistic graphics, 
enraging yet entertaining gameplay and simple one-tap controls”_.

[Anders Nissen][tw12] has released Game of Games for [Android][l23]. Game of Games is a retro arcade game created with HaxeFlixel. Some gameplay from the game can be seen in the video below.

Android Authority have written a developer interview with 
[Lars Quentmeier of Bytecombo][l24] who created Bronko Blue the Kitten Copter
using HaxeFlixel, along with [Katja Krone][tw13].

[Michel Käser][tw14] has written a pure Haxe [implementation][l25] of the 
[MurmurHash][l26] hash function, which is _“suitable for general hash-based lookups”_.

[Nico][tw15] has written a macro based system which creates a clean, re-mappable,
IDE friendly, JSON based, input handling for the luxe engine called [InputMacro][l27].

Silex Labs have written [Wrapping up WWX2014][l28] which goes into detail about
the viewer and attendee statistics and probably the most important, the people
who made WWX2014 happen.

To end this roundup, [Boyan Ololoevich][tw16] demonstrates in the video below 
new features which have landed in the IntelliJ IDEA Haxe plugin.

# Haxe Roundup № 302

![hxscout social](/img/302/hxscout.png "hxScout receiving frame timing data from OpenFL HXCPP app!")

[Jeff Ward][tw1] has started working on adding HXCPP support to [hxScout][l1], allowing
your native OpenFL, luxe engine or custom engine be to send telemetry data to hxScout.
This is something the Haxe community has wanted for an unfathomable amount of time!

![hxcout video](/img/302/hxscout.mp4 "hxScout in action receiving data from an HXCPP app!")

Another important library, [Fire Tongue][l3] by [Lars Doucet][tw3], a _“translation / 
localization framework written in Haxe” now supports loading data from TSV / CSV files
exported from Excel and LibreOffice. Not the _most_ exciting thing you've probably 
read, but Fire Tongue is the only released and maintained localization library 
currently available for Haxe that I'm aware of.

[Ohmnivore][tw2] has been busy working on his latest tool, [FlxSpriter][l2] which is
_“designed to complement various image editing software for spritesheet animators”_.
If you are editing a sprite sheet you will see the result in real time with the ability
to control the animation speed, manage multiple sprites and animations and more.

[Daniel Glazman's][tw4] [Quaxe][l4] library, which creates native desktop and mobile
application with native UI using Haxe and HTML5 has been [nominated][l5] for the
E-Toiles d'Or 2015 in the startup category. Good luck Daniel!

[Peter Stefcek][tw6] has released the first official alpha build of [Genome2D][l7],
version `1.1`. Currently _“Genome2D supports HTML5 target using WebGL with a Canvas
fallback and Flash/AIR target using Stage3D”_.

[Adi Reddy Mora][tw5] has written the [article][l6] Haxe Compiler Metadata. Adi lists
his favorite metadata that are all cross-platform with small bite size examples 
accompanying each metadata description.

[Tilman Schmidt][tw7] has released the final version of his [fireworks][l8] sim thats 
built using luxe engine.

If you're in or near Seattle, [Justin Donaldson][tw10] has posted about a [job][l12]
that would be suitable for a Haxer to join a _“large Seattle tech company”_.

I'll finish off this weeks short roundup with two games.

[Cyber Shells][l9] by [Luke Tramps][tw8], a dynamic game with each play completely
different from the last. Cyber Shells is built using OpenFL, Genome2D, PureMVC and
deployed on Adobe Air.

[Daktylos][l10] by [Sempai Games][tw9] created using OpenFL has been released
for [Android][l11] and with plans to release to iOS soon. In Daktylos you
_“help Daktylos, the last of his species, to survive in the prehistoric 
world full of dangers and enemies”_.

# Haxe Roundup № 222

[Frano Ponticelli][tw1] has written [The Benefits of Transpiling to JavaScript][l1]
over on [io.pellucid.com] which is a great introduction to Haxe for Javascript
developers investigating various ~~transpilers~~ compilers. In the article Franco
has been able to introduce alot of Haxe's features but in small, easy to understand,
effective chunks.

The [DOM4] Haxe implementation is progressing fast, created by [Daniel Glazman][tw2],
he has recently improved the Haxe XML parser by adding the ability for it to now
parse [XML namespaces], which also resulted in him adding a [XML serializer] for pretty
printing. There are also a [couple][l2] more additions you can check out.

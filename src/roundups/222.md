# Haxe Roundup № 222

[Frano Ponticelli][tw1] has written [The Benefits of Transpiling to JavaScript][l1]
over on [io.pellucid.com] which is a great introduction to Haxe for Javascript
developers investigating various ~~transpilers~~ compilers. In the article Franco
has been able to introduce a lot of Haxe's features but in small, easy to understand,
effective chunks.

The [DOM4] Haxe implementation is progressing fast, created by [Daniel Glazman][tw2],
he has recently improved the Haxe XML parser by adding the ability for it to now
parse [XML namespaces], which also resulted in him adding a [XML serializer] for pretty
printing. There are also a [couple][l2] more additions you can check out.

[Sven Bergström][tw3] has written [About Alpha Focus][l3], his first post since 
announcing Snõwkit in which Sven address some of the more common questions which have
popped up since launch, he also shares some of the analytics since launch and what the
plan is moving forward.

The community that is forming around Snõwkit continues to share articles. The most
recent being [Welcome to Westport] by [Kristian Brodal][tw4] which introduces his
censorship simulator and [Gesluxe Gesture Recongnizer] by [Josu Igoa][tw5].

The Snõwkit examples continue to appear, this week with a [random tile generator] 
by [Funk Moth][tw6], a `.ply` [importer][l4] for Luxe Engine and [big waves]
by [Tilman Schmidt][tw7] and finally a [preview][l5] of parallax, spawner and
movement components from Luxe Engine by [Guntur Sarwohadi][tw8]

![bullet physics](/img/222/z34.gif "Snõwkit bullet physics example by @dazKind")

A few games have been released this last week, [2048 Halloween] by [Andrew][tw9],
[Cyber Shells] by [Luke Tramps][tw11] both available on Google Play Store and
[Defends the Sushi] by [Namide][tw10] created during BeconGameJam 08.

[Jeff Ward][tw12] has written the article [Can OpenFL Recapture The Magic of Flash?][l6]
in which he explores what made Flash great in it hayday and how OpenFL can become
as successful as Flash once was.

![jeff map](/img/222/map.png "The reader map of @Jeff__Ward's OpenFL Haxe article")

[Ian Harrigan][tw13], author of [Haxe UI], has add a new component, the [divider]. 
That simple.

[Kirill Poletaev][tw14] continues to create HaxeFlixel [tutorials]. Since last
weeks roundup you could have learnt how to add a HUD, collision detection, potion
pickups, wondering enemies, chasing AI, implementing combat and more all on
[haxecoder.com].

A recent discovery is [player03.com] which has a bunch of recent OpenFL tutorials,
but instead of creating games, it is, currently, focused on the low level side of 
OpenFL, how to create OpenFL extensions, Overriding your `AndroidManifest.xml` file
and more.

There hasn't been much IDE news these last few weeks, but the HIDE editor, currently
on its development branch, has support for Flambe. As far as I understand
[Fabricio Gonçalves][tw15] contributed this recent addition to HIDE and has
written a [feature tour][l7] article showing you how to get started.

And finally, Haxe syntax highlighting has been added to [Emacs], in _2010_.

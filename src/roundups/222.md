# Haxe Roundup № 222

[Frano Ponticelli][tw1] has written [The Benefits of Transpiling to JavaScript][l1]
over on [io.pellucid.com] which is a great introduction to Haxe for Javascript
developers investigating various ~~transpilers~~ compilers. In the article Franco
has been able to introduce alot of Haxe's features but in small, easy to understand,
effective chunks.

The [DOM4] Haxe implementation is progressing fast, created by [Daniel Glazman][tw2],
he has recently improved the Haxe XML parser by adding the ability for it to now
parse [XML namespaces], which also resulted in him adding a [XML serializer] for pretty
printing. There are also a [couple][l2] more additions you can check out.

[Sven Bergström][tw3] has written [About Alpha Focus][l3], his first post since 
annouceing Snõwkit in which Sven address some of the more common questions which have
popped up since luanch, he also shares some of the analytics since launch and what the
plan is moving forward.

The community that is forming around Snõwkit continues to share articles. The most
recent being [Welcome to Westport] by [Kristian Brodal][tw4] which introduces his
censorship simulator and [Gesluxe Gesture Recongnizer] by [Josu Igoa][tw5].

The Snõwkit examples continue to appear, this week with a [random tile generator] 
by [Funk Moth][tw6], a `.ply` [importer][l4] for Luxe Engine and [big waves]
by [Tilman Schmidt][tw7] and finally a [preview][l5] of parallax, spawner and
movement components from Luxe Engine by [Guntur Sarwohadi][tw8]

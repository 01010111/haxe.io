# Haxe Roundup № 318

[Simone Cingano][gh1] has, available from GitHub, [TileCraft][l1] a 2.5D modeling
program written with OpenFL. TileCraft is touted as being a _“fast multi-platform 
modeling tool to make tiles for games, icons or whatever you want”_. The project has
decent documentation, with a [quick start][l2] guide, how to build [from source][l3],
ready to use [examples][l4] and more. This is one to watch.

Another library from [Simone][gh1], [akifox-asynchttp][l5], a _“multi-platform 
asynchronous HTTP+HTTPS requests [library]”_ has been updated, adding SSL support,
custom headers, redirection handling and lots [more][l6].

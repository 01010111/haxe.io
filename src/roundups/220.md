# Haxe Roundup № 220

[Sven Bergström][tw1] has released an impressive set of brand new libraries for Haxe,
[flõw], [snõw] and [luxe], all of which are part of [Snõwkit].

With the alpha release of Snõwkit, Sven has given the community a set of libraries
which allow you to deploy to Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS and WebGL, using Luxe,
a high level game engine, or Snõw, a low level platform framework, both of which use
Flõw, a build tool for Haxe.

Head over to Sven's [official announcement][l1] of Snõwkit for a detailed introduction. 
Since the announcement of Snõwkit, people have been releasing demo's and experiments 
showing their progress with Snõwkit.

One of the first demo's is [star field] by [Jonathan][tw2], who has recently written
[Working with Snõwkit][l2] who has started work on another [demo][l3], which is 
still in progress.

Other demo's and experiments include a small [stress test][l4] by [Tiago Ling 
Alexandre][tw3], [a][l8] [bunch][l5] [of][l6] [experiments][l7] by [Tilman Schmidt][tw4]
, who has also written [Isometric view in Luxe Engine][l9], [Gradient Component][l10]
by [Abel Toy][tw5] and [Luxe Engine Urban Experiment][l11] by [Samuel Hockham][tw6].

[Thomas][tw8] already created FlashDevelop templates for Snõwkit and has 
written how to install the templates and the current limitations [over][l13]
on Snõwkit.

Let's finish the Snõwkit mini roundup off with the article [Let it snow!][l12] by
[Michael Bickel][tw7] who explains his technology stack for his _“unannounced 3D 
game and engine targeting desktop platforms using Haxe, flõw, snõw and foo3d”_.

The latest addition to the Haxe family is [official support][l14] for NodeJS! The
Haxe Foundation decided to adopt [Eduardo Dias da Costa][tw9] repository who 
originally create the NodeJS externs.

When the next version of Haxe is released, hopefully with the NodeJS support in
the standard library, you might want to look at using [Justin Donaldson's][tw10]
[promhx] library, which might include [Sam MacPherson's][tw11] [pull request][l15]
for automatically promisifying NodeJS style functions.

[Clément Charmet][tw12], someone who has been using Haxe and NodeJS for a long time
and used them both on the project [Get Load Paris][l16] for [Converse][tw13] has 
been awarded two bronzes and one silver from the IAB Mixx Awards and CLIO Awards.

[Daniel Glazman][tw19], in a matter of days, has created a working [DOM4] implementation
in pure Haxe. I guess him being a W3C co-chairman has nothing to do with that `;)`. A
compliant HTML parser written in Haxe will lead to some interesting cross-platform
projects in the future.

![kha blender social](/img/220/kha.png "Lubos Lenco Kha and Blender integration")

[Kyle Travis][tw14] has written two articles, [Monthly Thoughts][l17] and [Haxe and
Google Play Services][l18]. In the Monthly Thoughts article he goes into some detail
on why he created his game and because he was using Haxe and OpenFL, he attempted to
hook into the Google Play API and had issues, which leads to his second article.

The [Clockword Acorn][tw17] team have released [Monsters and Medicine][l19] onto
the Google Play Store. Monsters and Medicine _“is a puzzle game where adaptation 
is key, players try to build and expand their own hospital while injured 
monsters are knocking at the door, wanting treatment”_.

[Ludovic Bas][tw18], creator of [Graal Seeker] has launched a Steam [Greenlight]
campaign. Graal Seeker is _“a 2D game that blends RPG with roguelike mechanics
and real-time tactical battles. It recreates the initiatory journey of a knight 
seeking the Holy Grail in fifth century Britain”_. You can also support the game
by contributing to Graal Seeker's [IndieGoGo] campaign.

It seems like it has been too long since some official OpenFL news, anyway, the OpenFL
team has announced [OpenFL 2.1 Beta][openfl] that comes with a combined codebase and
a new Lime.

Some of OpenFL's new features will benefit the Away3D port by [Greg Caldwell][tw15],
who has released [Away3D] `1.0.4a` which now generates mipmaps on the GPU and has
anisotropic filtering. [Checkout] the example of the new features.

And to finish off this weeks roundup, a new HTML5 backend for OpenFL has been released
by [Nick Grebenshikov][tw16], called [OpenFL SnapSVG] which uses SnapSVG under 
the hood.

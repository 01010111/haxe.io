# Haxe Roundup № 228

Lets kick off with a list of chat channels available to the community in order of
activity, it might be useful to some LD this weekend:

1. Haxe IRC [channel][l6].
1. Haxe Slack Chat [channel][l1] which requires you to request [access][l2].
1. Snowkit Gitter [channel][l4].
1. HaxeFlixel IRC [channel][l7].
1. Haxe Foundation Gitter [channel][l3].
1. OpenFL Slack Chat [channel][l5] which reuires you to request access on Twitter.
1. HaxePunk IRC [channel][l8].

Now lets jump into some tutorials and articles.

[Jason Sturges][tw1] has released three articles this last week and a half, with all
three articles being Mac orientated.

1. How to [install][l9] Haxe and OpenFL.
1. How to get Haxe and OpenFL [working][l10] in IntelliJ IDEA 14.
1. OpenFL [performance][l11] test with Mac, HTML5, Flash/Haxe, Flash/Air, Flash/Pro
and Neko platforms being evaluated.

[Xenizo Games][tw2] have written a couple of followup articles after their 
[Implementing Barrage][l12] article. Their first [article][l13] focuses on getting 
Nape and Barrage to play nice and the second [article][l14] continues to explore
different ways to further connect Nape into Barrage.

The final article is from [Joaquin Bello][tw3] called [Sequential Programming][l14] in
which Joaquin goes through creating a class that _“executes one function, wait 
until it’s done, execute the next function until there are no more functions to 
execute”_.

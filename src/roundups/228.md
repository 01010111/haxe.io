# Haxe Roundup № 228

Lets kick off with a list of chat channels available to the community in order of
activity, it might be useful to some LD this weekend:

1. Haxe IRC [channel][l6].
1. Haxe Slack Chat [channel][l1] which requires you to request [access][l2].
1. Snõwkit  Gitter [channel][l4].
1. HaxeFlixel IRC [channel][l7].
1. Haxe Foundation Gitter [channel][l3].
1. OpenFL Slack Chat [channel][l5] which requires you to request access on Twitter.
1. HaxePunk IRC [channel][l8].

The OpenFL team has created and released the [feature matrix][l15] which shows the
differences between OpenFLs targets, Flash, HTML5, Native and Native Next. The feature
matrix appears to cover the entire API.

Luxe engine which is part of snõwkit has a [recap][l16] post titled Alpha-1.0+parrott
Recap. [Sven Bergström][tw4] sums up the new features and changes introduced 
by contributors to the first focus sheet.

And for those of you on Twitter, there is a luxe engine [twitter account][tw5] you
can follow for future updates and related news.

A event which is happening this coming week is the first Haxe cross-platform
roundtable at GameDuell, this Tuesday December 9th in Berlin at 6.30pm. If your 
able to attend head over to the [meetup][l35] page to register.

Now lets jump into some tutorials and articles.

[Jason Sturges][tw1] has released three articles this last week and a half, with all
three articles being Mac orientated.

1. How to [install][l9] Haxe and OpenFL.
1. How to get Haxe and OpenFL [working][l10] in IntelliJ IDEA 14.
1. OpenFL [performance][l11] test with Mac, HTML5, Flash/Haxe, Flash/Air, Flash/Pro
and Neko platforms being evaluated.

[Xenizo Games][tw2] have written a couple of followup articles after their 
[Implementing Barrage][l12] article. Their first [article][l13] focuses on getting 
Nape and Barrage to play nice and the second [article][l36] continues to explore
different ways to further connect Nape into Barrage.

An article I have been hoping would be written is [HXCPP Externs][l17] by 
[Wighawag][tw6]. In the article, Wighawag talks about handing full control of the
main entry point to a CPP engine, handling CPP to Haxe and Haxe to CPP. Haxe to CPP
uses the latest nightly build features of Haxe and HXCPP which helps reduces the 
complexity of writing native extensions.

The final article is from [Joaquin Bello][tw3] called [Sequential Programming][l14] in
which Joaquin goes through creating a class that _“executes one function, wait 
until it’s done, execute the next function until there are no more functions to 
execute”_.

[Adi Reddy Mora][tw7] has created a [demo][l19] which integrates pixi.js and the 
Nape physics engine together, with [source][l20]. Adi has also created 
[documentation][l18] for pixi.js extern API using the chxdoc library.

[Jonas Nyström][tw8] has created a _“Haxe reinterpretation of the MT5 Web 
Audio Mixer”_. The Haxe Web [Audio Mixer][l21] does not include any server code
and has the song data hardcoded. Checkout the [live demo][l22].

[François Nicaise][tw9], a long time Haxer has setup a [Patreon page][l23]. 
François has spent _“a great amount of time helping [his] french friends 
release their games through the FrenchCows network”_. He has also released
three commercial games [Mind Labyrinth][l24], [Strange Masks][l25] and 
[81 Rock and Roll][l26] puzzle game. Go [support][l23] him!

Now onto recently released, re/discovered Haxe powered games.

[5734l3r][l27] is a _“platformer that focuses on the atmosphere and exploration. 
We want to make something cinematic and very detailed to thoroughly describe the 
world of robots”_. 5734l3r is created with Haxe and OpenFL.

[Wereworlf Tycoon][l28] created by [Joe Williamson][tw10] and [Sam Twidale][tw11] is
a game where you _“become the Big Bad Wolf of Werewolf Park in this werewolf stealth
simulation game”_ made with HaxeFlixel available on [Google Play][l29] and coming
soon to the App Store.

![youtube](DnEJ6TqZ0XE)

[GameSys Media][l30] have create [Zoi: The Escape][l31] for mobile and [web][l32] 
through Flash created with HaxeFlixel.

Running Snake available from the [Google Play][l33] Store by [Phyziko Games][tw12]
using Haxe and OpenFL _“is the number one game in the world of jumping snake games”_.

From the Motion Twin team is [Street Writer][l34] powered by Haxe and OpenFL is a
_“free crossword game that breaks all the rules”_ by stealing letters, laying traps
and blowing words away.

A game thats in the making is Ghost Splash by [NoHuman Studo][tw13] which uses Haxe
and OpenFL.

I'll finish this weeks roundup off with [Boyan Ololoevich's][tw14] latest howto 
video which shows you how to get `haxelib` completion for NME and OpenFL based
projects in IntelliJ IDEA.

# Haxe Roundup № 319

The HaxeFlixel [team][gh1] have finally luanched their [Patreon][l1] page, so if
your able to provide finanically support to help cover hosting costs and fund
future developement costs, then seriously consider it. 

The HaxeFlixel team are currently discussing how to distribute the donated money, 
with the outcome being [documented][l2] in the future, I assume.

[Leong Wai Yin][tw1] who has been steadily been releasing quaility HaxeFlixel tutorials
has released another, this time explaining two ways to do [Parallax Scrolling][l3].

[Justin Helms][tw2] has released [Sleep Furiously][l4], built using HaxeFlixel. Sleep
Furiously is available from the [App Store][l5], [Play Store][l6] and 
[Amazon][l7]. Take a look at the trailer below.

[Pete Shand][tw4] has posted a [teaser][l10] of the Haxe ported Away3D and Starling 
libraries playing nicely together, with the demo compiled to JavaScript.

[Matthijs Kamstra][tw3] has [written][l8] about using OpenFL to help generate 
papertoys to be printed with the [Cricut Explore][l9]. As Matthijs says in his
article, its great to see Haxe used for something other than games.

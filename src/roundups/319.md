# Haxe Roundup № 319

The HaxeFlixel [team][gh1] have finally luanched their [Patreon][l1] page, so if
your able to provide finanically support to help cover hosting costs and fund
future developement costs, then seriously consider it. 

The HaxeFlixel team are currently discussing how to distribute the donated money, 
with the outcome being [documented][l2] in the future, I assume.

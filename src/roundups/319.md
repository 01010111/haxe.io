# Haxe Roundup № 319

The HaxeFlixel [team][gh1] have finally launched their [Patreon][l1] page, so if
you're able to provide financially support to help cover hosting costs and fund
future development costs, then seriously consider it. 

The HaxeFlixel team are currently discussing how to distribute the donated money, 
with the outcome being [documented][l2] in the future, I assume.

[Leong Wai Yin][tw1] who has been steadily been releasing quality HaxeFlixel tutorials
has released another, this time explaining two ways to do [Parallax Scrolling][l3].

[Justin Helms][tw2] has released [Sleep Furiously][l4], built using HaxeFlixel. Sleep
Furiously is available from the [App Store][l5], [Play Store][l6] and 
[Amazon][l7]. Take a look at the trailer below.

Another HaxeFlixel built game has been released, [Fruit Shark][l16] by 
[Eduardo Lopes][tw8] during Lets Cook Jam and available on GameJolt.

[Pete Shand][tw4] has posted a [teaser][l10] of the Haxe ported Away3D and Starling 
libraries playing nicely together, with the demo compiled to JavaScript.

[Nikolay Grebenshikov][tw7] has published the first draft of the [Jive UI][l13]
website which is built with itself. Jive UI is built on top of OpenFL, [Bindx][l14]
and [HML][l15] to bring you a crossplatform UI framework, with MVVM, data binding, 
a contemporary UI and improved performance.

[Matthijs Kamstra][tw3] has [written][l8] about using OpenFL to help generate 
paper toys to be printed with the [Cricut Explore][l9]. As Matthijs says in his
article, its great to see Haxe used for something other than games.

[Juno Nguyen][tw5] has released the source code to his game Celox Inpes onto
[GitHub][l11] which is a _“re-creation of ABAGames' Charge Rush, using Luxe 
Engine, for purpose of learning”_.

Another project you can learn from, which also uses luxe engine, is [vshooter][l12]
by [Jonathan Hirz][tw6], which is a vertical space shooter.

[Kirill Poletaev][tw9] has posted a new [tutorial][l17] to `haxecoder.com` titled
_JSON in Haxe: Parsing, encoding, replacing_.

[Anders Nissen][tw10] has tweeted that he has started a new series of posts on his
[blog][l18], _Awesome Game Dev Topics to Revisit_.

To finish this weeks roundup off, a sample of new and updated libraries to HaxeLib.

+ [Golems][l19], a _“macro-backed system for compiling and embedding workers 
into larger builds. Supports Flash, JS, NekoVM and C++ targets”_.
+ [TJSON][l20], a _“tolerant JSON parser and encoder. Unserializes and serializes 
JSON data, but without all the strictness of standard JSON parsers”_.
+ [Haxe GA][l21], a _“generic Google Analytics client that implements nearly 
every parameter and tracking feature of the original GA Javascript client”_.
+ [Check Style][l22], an _“automated code analysis ideal for projects that want to enforce a coding standard”_.

# Haxe Roundup № 305

![wwx 2015 social](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

[Silex Labs][tw1] have announced that the next Haxe Conference, WWX2015 will be hosted
in Paris between the 29th May and 1st June!

[Hugh Sanderson][tw2] has released HXCPP `3.1.68` to [haxelib][l1] which brings
optimizations to hashes and various other speed improvements affecting `Map`.
For more information on the low level additions checkout the HXCPP [changelog][l2].
You might need to grab a [nightly build][l8] of Haxe to get these improvements.

The Away3D OpenFL [port][l3] has been updated to `1.1` by [Greg Caldwell][tw3]. With 
this update Greg has migrated to using OpenFL's Stage3D implementation which 
improves Flash compatibility.

A few weeks ago Haxe Studio `0.5` was [released][l5] by [Pah Arif][gh1] which was
announced on the Haxe [mailing list][l4] which received _mixed_ feelings towards it.

The [HXSSL][l6] has also been updated with a bunch of various new methods by
[Pascal][tw4] from Motion Twins. According to [Sam McPherson][tw5], this update
allows you to _“run TLS enabled servers in Neko/CPP”_.

Sam has also pointed out that SHA224 has [landed][l7] in the Haxe [nightly builds][l8],
now sitting along side `Alder32`, `Crc32`, `Hmac`, `Md5`, `SHA1` and `SHA256` 
implementations in the standard library and to top it off, add the various crypto 
classes from [hxBitcoin][l9].

[Nicolas Cannasse][tw10] recently tweeted about his work inprogress library
[hxsdl][l15] which provides HXCPP bindings to [libsdl][l16].

[Samuel Twidale][tw6] has created an [extension][l10] for OpenFL which gives you 
access to Amazon's Game Circle leaderboards and achievements, currently only 
supporting Android.

[Federico Bricker][tw7] has also created an OpenFL extension called [Native 
Dialog][l11] which allows you to call native dialogs on Android, iOS and HTML5.

Federico has also created [Stub Libs][l12], a library which is _“a bunch of 
stub classes, useful for debugging your app if you have issues you suspect to 
be part of an external library”_.

[Andy Li][tw8] has written about how to [Install Haxe on Windows using 
Chocolatey][l13], the windows package manager. Andy explains the reason to use
Chocolatey.

> The major benefit of using it instead of the official Windows 
installer is that the process can be all done in the command line, which is the 
only option in a CI environment like AppVeyor.

[PDeveloper][tw9] has written an introduction post on [hxE2 and Entity Systems][l14]
which explains the past of `hxE`, the predecessor to `hxE2` and the future plans of
`hxE2`. You can grab a copy of [hxE2][l14] from GitHub.

[Sven Bergström][tw11] has written [web "livereload" example][l17] over on the
[snowkit.org][l18] community site showcasing a third party tools features, with
similar built in asset reloading planned for a future release.

This is pretty impressive, [Joesfiene Pertosa][tw12] has found out that OpenFL
is part of the University of Castilla-La Mancha [curriculum][l20].

[Franco Ponticelli][tw12] has created [Fly Maze][l21], a game where you are a fly
and you have two minutes to eat all the flies. Franco used Haxe and his entity
system library [Edge][l22] to create Fly Maze.

![dungeon of gain ui](/img/305/gain.jpg "New UI of Dungeon of Gain by @Defroids using HaxeFlixel")

[Lubos Lenco][tw13] has created a [puzzle game][l23] made completely with 
Blender and Haxe! I'm assuming it uses Kha and Lubos's [Fox][l24] library.

[Toggle Games][l25] have released [Time Scope][l26] a _“retro futuristic mobile
game built with Haxe and OpenFL”_, currently available for Android and coming to
iOS soon.

A game released a few weeks ago by the [Motion Twin][l27] team is [Street Writer][l28]
which is powered by Haxe and OpenFL is now available on [Android][l29] and [iOS][l30].

Let finish this roundup off with [Ohmnivore's][tw13] Global Game Jam 2015 game created
with Haxe and HaxeFlixel [Divided by Zero][l31].

> The internet has shut down in Montreal. You have to leave your computer and do 
activities to keep yourself entertained.

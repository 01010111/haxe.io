# Haxe Roundup № 305

![wwx 2015 social](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

[Silex Labs][tw1] have announced that the next Haxe Conference, WWX2015 will be hosted
in Paris between the 29th May and 1st June!

[Hugh Sanderson][tw2] has released HXCPP `3.1.68` to [haxelib][l1] which brings
optimizations to hashes and various other speed improvements affecting `Map`.
For more information on the low level additions checkout the HXCPP [changelog][l2].
You might need to grab a [nightly build][l8] of Haxe to get these improvements.

The Away3D OpenFL [port][l3] has been updated to `1.1` by [Greg Caldwell][tw3]. With 
this update Greg has migrated to using OpenFL's Stage3D implementation which 
improves Flash compatibility.

A few weeks ago Haxe Studio `0.5` was [released][l5] by [Pah Arif][gh1] which was
announced on the Haxe [mailing list][l4] which recieved _mixed_ feelings towards it.

The [HXSSL][l6] has also been updated with a bunch of various new methods by
[Pascal][tw4] from Motion Twins. According to [Sam McPherson][tw5], this update
allows you to _“run TLS enabled servers in Neko/CPP”_.

Sam has also pointed out that SHA224 has [landed][l7] in the Haxe [nightly builds][l8],
now sitting along side `Alder32`, `Crc32`, `Hmac`, `Md5`, `SHA1` and `SHA256` 
implementations in the standard library and to top it off, add the various crypto 
classes from [hxBitcoin][l9].

[Samuel Twidale][tw6] has created an [extension][l10] for OpenFL which gives you 
access to Amazon's Game Circle leaderboards and achievements, currently only 
supporting Android.

[Federico Bricker][tw7] has also created an OpenFL extension called [Native 
Dialog][l11] which allows you to call native dialogs on Android, iOS and HTML5.

Federico has also created [Stub Libs][l12], a library which is _“just a bunch of 
stub classes, useful for debugging your app if you have issues you suspect to 
be part of an external library”_.

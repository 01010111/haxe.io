# Haxe Roundup № 210

Lets start off with probably the biggest news, [Greg Caldwell][tw1] has released
Away3D `1.0.0-alpha`, available now from [haxelib][l1], which is a complete port to
OpenFL working across all platforms. This release includes model loading of 3DS, AWD,
MD5, MD2 DAE formats, skeleton and skinned animation and plenty more. 

Greg has written [OpenFL port of Away3D 1.0.0-alphia Released][l2] where he provides
information on installing and some current problem areas for afew platforms. He also has
the following video showing the demos, which are also available as [HTML5 and Flash][l3],
running on the Nexus 7 and the iPad 3.

[Tomek][tw2] has continued working on [Weblog][l4], the remote debugger for Haxe, mainly
working on the aesthetics.

[Boyan Ololoevich][tw3] has taken some time away from HIDE this week and has released
Haxe autocompletion plugins for the [Atom] editor, [Haxe AutoComplete][l5] and [Haxe
AutoComplete Plus][l6]. The plus version is asynchronous giving you completion
as you type.

[Boyan][tw3] has also added Haxe support to [sloc], a npm module which simply counts
lines of source code.

[David Elahee][tw4] has recently added auto batching for sprites and shader
pool support to [h3d][l7], a lightweight 3D engine for Haxe used by Motion-Twins and
Shiro Games.

[Chimango Games][tw5] have recently released Pewma to the Google [Play Store][l8]
and coming soon to iOS, created with Haxe, OpenFL and HaxeFlixel.

[Sergio Barrio][tw6] has written [A Love Letter to HaxeFlixel][l9], I think the
article title says it all.

[Ben Morris][tw7] has published [GRADQUEST] and [Gorilla Defense] Windows, Mac and Linux
builds, using Haxe, now available from Itch.io.

[Ohmnivore][tw9] has released [FlxShell] which is an abstracted Linux environment for
HaxeFlixel, using [HxCLAP] which is his command line parser. Most of FlxShell's 
commands support redirection operators allowing for powerful combinations. FlxShell
originally came about to be used in a game allowing players to interact with
consoles and shells. Take a look at the [demo][l10] and try some of [the example][l11]
commands. Very clever.

[Nico][tw8] has released [IceEntity] `1.0.0` featuring IDE compliant Haxe scripting,
live reloading function and variables and also entity xml instancing.

[Thomas Bauldon][tw10] has created his first OpenFL native extension, [OpenFLWebView],
which as you might have guessed, allows you to display a web page in your OpenFL
app. Its currently Android only, but iOS support is planned.

For HaxePunk, [Aaron Shea][tw13] has created a particle emitter [editor] with
plans for it to support exporting ready to use code snippets.

[George McBay][tw11] has written [how to][l12] use Haxe on [Chumby][tw12] to create
a simple widget. George also intends to produce future tutorials covering Haxe.

[Allan Dowdeswell][tw14] shows his addiction to everything Haxe with a Haxe license plate.

[Justin][g+1] has [shared] how he now updates the various xml build files via a 
command line program compiled to Neko. You can find the [source][l13] available on
GitHub.

Recent changes coming to a future version of Haxe are, firstly, `@:genericBuild` now allows
an arbitrary amount of [type parameters] by using `Rest`. [Dan Korostelev][tw15] has
created a sample [Signal] class builder and a simple [Tuple] builder as examples of
whats possible. Secondly, [Nicolas Cannasse][tw16] has [started] working on Unicode
support for the Neko compile target.

And to finish, [Oleg][gh1] has created [LuaXe], a Lua compile target, using a custom
generator instead of a dedicated ocaml backend and also has another project called
[llvmaxe-haxe-llvm] which says its a _“Haxe LLVM code gen backend”_.

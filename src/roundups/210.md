# Haxe Roundup № 210

Lets start off with probably the biggest news, [Greg Caldwell][tw1] has released
Away3D `1.0.0-alpha`, available now from [haxelib][l1], which is a complete port to
OpenFL working across all platforms. This release includes model loading of 3DS, AWD,
MD5, MD2 DAE formats, skeleton and skinned animation and plenty more. 

Greg has written [OpenFL port of Away3D 1.0.0-alphia Released][l2] where he provides
information on installing and some current problem areas for some platforms. He also has
the following video showing the demos, which are also availble as [HTML5 and Flash][l3],
running on the Nexus 7 and the iPad 3.

[Tomek][tw2] has continued working on [Weblog][l4], the remote debugger for Haxe, mainly
working on the astetics.

[Boyan Ololoevich][tw3] has taken some time away from HIDE this week and has released
Haxe autocompletion plugins for the [Atom] editor, [Haxe AutoComplete][l5] and [Haxe
AutoComplete Plus][l6]. The plus version is asynchronous meaning you get completion
as you type.

[Boyan][tw3] has also added Haxe support to [sloc], a npm module which simply counts
lines of source code.

[David Elahee][tw4] has recently added auto batching for sprites and shader
pool support to [h3d][l7], a light weight 3D engine for Haxe used by Motion-Twins and
Shiro Games.

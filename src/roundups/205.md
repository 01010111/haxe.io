[Alexander Hohlov][tw2] has written [Caching Refactoring][l2] in which he goes into
some detail on some decisions he has made towards graphics caching in HaxeFlixel.

[Vadim][tw3] who has created numerous games, tutorials and tools, some of which are Haxe
related has started a [Patreon][l3] page. Probably the most notable Haxe library Vadim

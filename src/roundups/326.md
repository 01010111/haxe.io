# Haxe Roundup № 326

![framework talk motion twin wgc2015](/img/326/framework_talk.jpg "David Elahee (@blackmagic_mt) at WGC2015 talking about frameworks and Haxe.")

This weeks main news, _in my opinion_, is that [Andy Li][tw1] is now officially
[working][l1] for the Haxe Foundation!

> Every month, I will work on a specific task, like the jQuery support upgrade. 
I will also work on other haxe-related things concurrently, e.g. updating the Haxe 
Chocolatey package, fixing CI issues, writing docs, and try to wrap my head around 
OCaml and start fixing compiler bugs.

Andy will also be speaking at various events, with his first talk since working
for the foundation, already done and dusted at the Hong Kong Open Source 
Conference 2015. Andy has already published his talks [slides][l2] from HKOSCon 
2015 and I'm also [hosting][l3] a PDF backup copy _just_ in case the 
original disapears.

One last thing Andy has achieved this last week, he has managed to get the
Haxe chocolatey [package][l4] updated to `3.2.0`.

[Elliott Stoneham][tw2], author of [TARDIS Go][l5] has improved the transpiled 
benchmarks following pointer optimizations. The worst is `16.8x` Golangs time, 
down from `36.6x`. The Haxe Java target performs the best with it performing 
`1.2x` to `3.5x` Golangs speed, down from `12.5x`.

[François Nicaise][tw3] has written a great [article][l6] “Haxe + HTML5 = I can breathe!”,
in which describes how he uses various tools and frameworks, like PixiJS and TexturePacker
to not only target the web, but native platforms all with quick iteration. He's
also on [Patreon][l6], you should support him.

[Hugh Sanderson][tw4], part of the compiler team HXCPP and NME author has
[published][l8] “NME **still** rocks”. With NME _over_ **8** years old, Hugh states
that NME provides stability, innovation and pragmatism for developers choosing
a framework. He also helps you get (re)acquainted with NME and introduces you to
the Acadnme runtime, a [cppia][l9] runtime.

[Dan Korostelev][tw5], another compiler developer, has [published][l10] a gist
showing how to write HXCPP externs that interface with native code, in this example,
the SDL library _without_ writing **any** CFFI code.

# Haxe Roundup № 326

![framework talk motion twin wgc2015 social](/img/326/frameworks_talk.jpg "David Elahee (@blackmagic_mt) at WGC2015 talking about frameworks and Haxe.")

This weeks main news, _in my opinion_, is that [Andy Li][tw1] is now [working][l1] for the Haxe Foundation! It's about time!

> Every month, I will work on a specific task, like the jQuery support upgrade. 
I will also work on other haxe-related things concurrently, e.g. updating the Haxe 
Chocolatey package, fixing CI issues, writing docs, and try to wrap my head around 
OCaml and start fixing compiler bugs.

Andy will also be speaking at various events, with his first talk since working
for the foundation, already done and dusted, was to speak at the Hong Kong Open 
Source Conference 2015. Andy has already published his talks 
[slides][l2] from HKOSCon 2015 and I'm also [hosting][l3] a PDF backup copy 
_just_ in case the original disappears.

One last thing Andy has achieved this last week, he has managed to get the
Haxe chocolatey [package][l4] updated to `3.2.0`!

[Elliott Stoneham][tw2], author of [TARDIS Go][l5] has improved the transpiled 
benchmarks, following pointer optimizations. The worst is `16.8x` Golangs speed, 
down from `36.6x`. The Haxe Java target performs the best with it performing 
`1.2x` to `3.5x` Golangs speed, down from `12.5x`.

[François Nicaise][tw3] has written a great [article][l6] “Haxe + HTML5 = I can breathe!”,
in which he describes how he uses various tools and frameworks, like PixiJS and TexturePacker
to not only target the web, but native platforms all with quick iteration. He's
also on [Patreon][l6], you should support him.

[Hugh Sanderson][tw4], part of the compiler team, also HXCPP and NME author has
[published][l8] “NME **still** rocks”. With NME _over_ **8** years old, Hugh states
that NME provides stability, innovation and pragmatism for developers looking for
a Haxe framework. He also helps you get (re)acquainted with NME and introduces you to
the Acadnme runtime, a [cppia][l9] runtime.

[Dan Korostelev][tw5], another compiler developer, has [published][l10] a gist
showing how to write HXCPP externs that interface with native code, in this example,
the SDL library _without_ writing **any** CFFI code.

An [article][l11] from Portugal, “Guerra dos Consoles: Haxe+OpenFL ao ataque!”, which
I think translates to “War of the Consoles: Haxe + OpenFL attack!”, detailing 
the importance of an open source project offering indies console targets.

Henry from [Fiery Squirrel][tw6] has written the [article][l12] “Collow: Work in
Progress”, an OpenFL powered game. The article details the updates made around
Collow and Fluff Eaters.

To finish this weeks roundup off, there are 3 tutorial related articles.

- HaxeFlixel Tutorial - [Camera Zoom Revisited][l13] by [Leong Wai Yin][tw7].
- [Debug the Haxe Compiler with OCamlDebug][l14] by [Ryusei][tw8].
- [Learn Haxe][l15] introduction by [Khaled Garbaya][tw9].

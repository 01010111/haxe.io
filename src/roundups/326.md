# Haxe Roundup № 326

![framework talk motion twin wgc2015](/img/326/framework_talk.jpg "David Elahee (@blackmagic_mt) at WGC2015 talking about frameworks and Haxe.")

This weeks main news, _in my opinion_, is that [Andy Li][tw1] is now officially
[working][l1] for the Haxe Foundation!

> Every month, I will work on a specific task, like the jQuery support upgrade. 
I will also work on other haxe-related things concurrently, e.g. updating the Haxe 
Chocolatey package, fixing CI issues, writing docs, and try to wrap my head around 
OCaml and start fixing compiler bugs.

Andy will also be speaking at various events, with his first talk since working
for the foundation, already done and dusted at the Hong Kong Open Source 
Conference 2015. Andy has already published his talks [slides][l2] from HKOSCon 
2015 and I'm also [hosting][l3] a PDF backup copy _just_ in case the 
original disapears.

One last thing Andy has achieved this last week, he has managed to get the
Haxe chocolatey [package][l4] updated to `3.2.0`.

[Elliott Stoneham][tw2], author of [TARDIS Go][l5] has improved the transpiled 
benchmarks following pointer optimizations. The worst is `16.8x` Golangs time, 
down from `36.6x`. The Haxe Java target performs the best with it performing 
`1.2x` to `3.5x` Golangs speed, down from `12.5x` .

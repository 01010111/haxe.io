# Haxe Roundup № 314

The [Haxor][tw1] team are back, releasing the [Web Bundle][l1] library onto
GitHub. This library isnt Haxe specific, written in JavaScript running through
NodeJS, Web Bundle aims to _“significantly reduce the number of HTTP 
requests allowing fast page loads”_ by compressing text data by at _“least
40% compressed”_.

Web Bundle by the Haxor team achieves this by packing everything into a single
PNG image taking advantage of browsers _“decompression routines are native
and fast”_. The idea is nothing new with the earliest post using this idea
is from [2008][l2].

The [TiVo][gh1] developer team have released `activity`, a _“cross-platform 
mechanism for allowing multiple contexts of execution to co-exist 
within a single program”_ onto [HaxeLib][l3] and [GitHub][l4]. Checkout the
introduction [thread][l5] to Activity over on the Haxe mailing list.

The [DateTime][l6] by [Alexander Kuzmenko][tw2] has recently been updated,
significantly reducing the timezone database size, _“reduced from 
2.5Mb to 116Kb”_. DateTime is a _“custom date-time implementation for Haxe
[which] does not store milliseconds information [and] contains classes 
and methods for manipulating intervals and date/time math.” Depending on the
target platform DateTime can be `7x` faster or `10x` slower.

[Jeff Ward][tw3] has updated HxScout with _“allocation and collection 
tracking [which is] working in HXCPP [and] finally useful in solving real 
issues in itself!”.

[Elliott Stoneham][gh2] whos working on [tardisgo][l7] a _“Golang to Haxe 
transpiler”_ has [documented][l8] the current state of the Golang
standard package when transpiled to Haxe and compiled to one of its targets.

[Sven Bergström][tw4] has published another Snõwkit developer log, titled
[Modularity][l9] in which he spent _“some time finalizing 
the underlying snõw API”_. That statement doesnt even justify the great
detail Sven has gone into in this weeks dev log.

[Tilman Schmidt][tw5] has written a great article over on the snõwkit 
community site documenting his progress on his [Polar Platform][l10] game, of
course using snõwkit and luxe engine. It looks like it is the making of a
great and challenging game.

Another article from the snõwkit site, by [Espen Breivik][tw6], titled
[Making a simple Isometric tile editor for Kenny.nl tiles][l11]. This article
is incredibly detailed and an interesting read on creating an editor.

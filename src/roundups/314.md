# Haxe Roundup № 314

The [Haxor][tw1] team are back, releasing the [Web Bundle][l1] library onto
GitHub. This library isnt Haxe specific, written in JavaScript running through
NodeJS, Web Bundle aims to _“significantly reduce the number of HTTP 
requests allowing fast page loads”_ by compressing text data by at _“least
40% compressed”_.

Web Bundle by the Haxor team achieves this by packing everything into a single
PNG image taking advantage of browsers _“decompression routines are native
and fast”_. The idea is nothing new with the earliest post using this idea
is from [2008][l2].

The [TiVo][gh1] developer team have released `activity`, a _“cross-platform 
mechanism for allowing multiple contexts of execution to co-exist 
within a single program”_ onto [HaxeLib][l3] and [GitHub][l4]. Checkout the
introduction [thread][l5] to Activity over on the Haxe mailing list.

The [DateTime][l6] by [Alexander Kuzmenko][tw2] has recently been updated,
significantly reducing the timezone database size, _“reduced from 
2.5Mb to 116Kb”_. DateTime is a _“custom date-time implementation for Haxe
[which] does not store milliseconds information [and] contains classes 
and methods for manipulating intervals and date/time math.” Depending on the
target platform DateTime can be `7x` faster or `10x` slower.

# Haxe Roundup № 314

The [Haxor][tw1] team are back, releasing the [Web Bundle][l1] library onto
GitHub. This library isnt Haxe specific, written in JavaScript running through
NodeJS, Web Bundle aims to _“significantly reduce the number of HTTP 
requests allowing fast page loads”_ by compressing text data by at _“least
40% compressed”_.

Web Bundle by the Haxor team achieves this by packing everything into a single
PNG image taking advantage of browsers _“decompression routines are native
and fast”_. The idea is nothing new with the earliest post using this idea
is from [2008][l2].

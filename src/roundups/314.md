# Haxe Roundup № 314

The [Haxor][tw1] team are back, releasing the [Web Bundle][l1] library onto
GitHub. This library isnt Haxe specific, written in JavaScript running through
NodeJS, Web Bundle aims to _“significantly reduce the number of HTTP 
requests allowing fast page loads”_ by compressing text data by at _“least
40% compressed”_.

Web Bundle by the Haxor team achieves this by packing everything into a single
PNG image taking advantage of browsers _“decompression routines are native
and fast”_. The idea is nothing new with the earliest post using this idea
is from [2008][l2].

The [TiVo][gh1] developer team have released `activity`, a _“cross-platform 
mechanism for allowing multiple contexts of execution to co-exist 
within a single program”_ onto [HaxeLib][l3] and [GitHub][l4]. Checkout the
introduction [thread][l5] to Activity over on the Haxe mailing list.

The [DateTime][l6] by [Alexander Kuzmenko][tw2] has recently been updated,
significantly reducing the timezone database size, _“reduced from 
2.5Mb to 116Kb”_. DateTime is a _“custom date-time implementation for Haxe
[which] does not store milliseconds information [and] contains classes 
and methods for manipulating intervals and date/time math.” Depending on the
target platform DateTime can be `7x` faster or `10x` slower.

[Jeff Ward][tw3] has updated HxScout with _“allocation and collection 
tracking [which is] working in HXCPP [and] finally useful in solving real 
issues in itself!”.

[Elliott Stoneham][gh2] whos working on [tardisgo][l7] a _“Golang to Haxe 
transpiler”_ has [documented][l8] the current state of the Golang
standard package when transpiled to Haxe and compiled to one of its targets.

[Sven Bergström][tw4] has published another Snõwkit developer log, titled
[Modularity][l9] in which he spent _“some time finalizing 
the underlying snõw API”_. That statement doesnt even justify the great
detail Sven has gone into in this weeks dev log.

[Tilman Schmidt][tw5] has written a great article over on the snõwkit 
community site documenting his progress on his [Polar Platform][l10] game, of
course using snõwkit and luxe engine. It looks like it is the making of a
great and challenging game.

Another article from the snõwkit site, by [Espen Breivik][tw6], titled
[Making a simple Isometric tile editor for Kenny.nl tiles][l11]. This article
is incredibly detailed and an interesting read on creating an editor.

[Patrick Le Clec'h][tw7] is back with a couple more hacking Haxe implementations.

+ [Destructuring][l12] in functions.
+ [Short][l13] classes, an incredibly terse way of defining classes, it looks great.

This should gain some traction as Haxe increases in popularity, the Checkstyle
[library][l14] by [Adi Reddy Mora][tw8] which is an _“automated code analysis
tool ideal for projects that want to enforce coding conventions”_.

For those of you who have wanted a macro tutorial, wait now more! Learn how to
[Create a Code Profiler in Haxe using Macros][l15] from Kenton Hamaluik, who guides
you through many macro features along the way. There are afew other tutorials
out there as well, [Compile Time Macros][l15] by [Sven Bergström][tw4] and
[Haxe Macros][l16] by [Mark Knol][tw9].

[Jason Sturges][tw10] has published [Flash and the Polyglot - roadmap for the
ubiquitous developer][l17] on the constant question for developers 
_Where to go from here?_

# Haxe Roundup № 197

If your attending [WWX2014] the 4th International Haxe Conference, then you're lucky.
But you will likely need somewhere to stay, so checkout the details for the official
[WWX2014 Hotel]. There is only a month until it kicks off!

[Nico Zimmermann][g+ 1] and his team from [Britzpeterman] have created another brilliant
piece of work created with Haxe/js call [Net Wars]. 

_“Inspired by current political discussions of leading world powers, netwars is a
fact-based TV documentary, interactive web documentary, TV movie and graphic novel 
app, which explores the impending threat of cyberwarfare.”_

![NetWarsProject]

Nico [posted][l 1] Net Wars to the Haxe mailing list where he goes into detail about 
the performance issues they encountered, the frameworks they used and the solutions
they came up with.

[Andreas Rønning][tw 1] has written [My story with HaxeNME and OpenFL][l 2] which is an
easy read, take your time sort of article with which so much rings true to my own
experience with Haxe. Worth a read.

[Samuel Batista][gh 1], one of the HaxeFlixel owners, has weighed in on the discussion
of [Flambe's development and contributions][l 3] with his opinion on how HaxeFlixel 
became so popular.

Development of the HaxeFlixel engine rapidly accelerated by the creation of teams, 
by promoting major contributors to team members and also with the separation of 
code into several repositories as the main factors to its success.

By following all the various libraries and the issues that are raised, you sometimes
come across issues which turn out to be a great little overview or reminder. In
particular issue [#2908], the `haxe_ver` conditional variable doesn't seem to support
patch numbers, as in `#if (haxe_ver >= 3.1.3)`. `haxe_ver` is treated as a Float, so
`3.1.3` would become `3.103`, `3.2.0` would be `3.200` and `3.1.10` would be `3.110`.

[Eduardo Dias][tw 2] creator of the upcoming WebGL engine, [Haxor][tw 3], has a
[preview][l 4] of the microsite created using only Haxors UI classes.

[Ventroy Rolle][gh 2] has created Haxe bindings for DirectX. [HaxeDx] uses _“generated
Haxe C# code to create DirectX applications, using the SharpDX library.”_ HaxeDx is
meant to be a proof of concept for Lime integration.

The [OpenFL][tw 4] team have released `1.4.0` with significant changes. In the 
[blog post][l 5] the most significant change is the new Lime and NME collaborative
backend in which OpenFL and the reborn NME library have joined forces to unify their
efforts to build a stable, fast native backend for all Haxe projects.

The OpenFL team have also improved upon the beta HTML5 backend to bring a more
consistent Flash experience with better Canvas support and automated WebFont support.
They have also added support for older or slower devices which uses the new DOM
renderer using `-Ddom`. A WebGL renderer is planned, but only as a progressive
enhancement.

The C++ side is no longer split between HXCPP and HxLibc since last weeks release
of HXCPP `3.1.30` which is a unified combination of both libraries to make the best
C++ library. All of HxLibc improvements have been merged into HXCPP and with the reunification
of these libraries an improved release schedule is now possible.

[Michel Käser][tw 5] has released [hxdispatch][l 6] `2.0.1`. Hxdispatch is _“an
optionally asynchronous dispatch library for Haxe”_ with this release being the
first highly usable and tested version working on all major targets. Looks promising.

[Sam MacPherson][gh 3] has been reworking his Amazon Web Services [libraries][l 7]
DynamoDB portion to be compatible with [SPOD], the simple persistent objects database
library.

[Vadim][gh 4] has created and [written][l 9] about his `.properties` parser which is a
simplistic, minimally tricky `String.indexOf` implementation that just works while
having minimal impact on performance and memory.

[Colapsydo][tw 6] has created [Intra][l 8] an old school raycast 3D procedural
labyrinth adventure game created using OpenFL.

![Intra]

[Andy Li][gh 5] has created an impressive library which gives Haxe the ability to
create anonymous classes similar to Java, using the library [hxAnonCls].

Andy has also created [DashDox] which allows you to have the Haxe API show up in
the [Dash] app.

[Leonardo Sá][gh 6] has created a small library that converts Haxe classes, objects
to Xml and back. The library is called [cereal].

And finally, over on the HaxeFlixel mailing list a [call for action][l 10] has been
put out to help the development team make a `3.3.0` release by testing all the 
demos on the Flash target and at least one C++ target.

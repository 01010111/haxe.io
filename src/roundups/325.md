# Haxe Roundup № 325

![gameduell workshop social](/img/325/gameduell.jpg "@GameDuell running a Haxe workshop for new team members")

[Sven Bergström][tw1] posted the [article][[l1] “Snõwkit Dev Log #5 _phoenix_”, the
_long_ awaited snõwkit collective update. This dev log focuses on `alpha-3.0` new
renderer, its past and future.

Another snõwkit [article][l2], this time by [Espen Breivik][tw2], which is a
proof of concept _“using hscript to program entity behaviours in luxe”_. I enjoy
posts like this, as Espen has gone into detail of modifying hscript, the problems
and solutions he worked through. It's one of the more lengthier posts on snõwkit, 
but still an interesting read.

In last weeks [roundup][l3] I linked to [Jonathan Hirz's][tw3] article about him
working on his `#fathersdayjam` created with luxe engine. Well Fathers Day has
come and gone, and Jonathan has posted over on the snowkit community [Backyard
Roguelike][l4], a breif overview of his game and `#fathersdayjam`.

Head over to Jonathan's [itch.io][l5] page to download [BYRL - backyard roguelike][l5]
which is available for both Windows and Mac.

[Luca Mezzalira][tw4] has been working on `haxe-watchify`, which is still in
developement and as you _should_ be able to guess by the name, automatically
recompiles your code. From [this][l6] picture on Twitter it will be powered by
NodeJS.

[Hugh Sanderson][tw5] has released his [slides][l7] presented at this years WWX.
There is _so_ much interesting info contained in those slides, definitely
check it out. I wrote an quick overview of [Cppia][l8], a new HXCPP target, which
is one of _many_ interesting topics Hugh talked about.

Something that was devised between [Cauê Waneck][tw6] and Hugh at WWX2015
is an [implementation][l9] that will _“allow [you] to interoperate with 
Objective-C code directly from Haxe, by defining special extern classes by
adding the `@:objc` meta and `-D objc` define”_. Take [a look][l10] at the current
test classes which show uses of `NSNumber` and `NSString`.

The [Ipsilon Developements][tw7] team have released their latest game [Assembly Rush][l13]
to [iOS][l11] and [Android][l12] stores, created with OpenFL.

# Haxe Roundup № 325

![gameduell workshop social](/img/325/gameduell.jpg "@GameDuell running a Haxe workshop for new team members")

[Sven Bergström][tw1] posted the [article][[l1] “Snõwkit Dev Log #5 _phoenix_”, the
_long_ awaited snõwkit collective update. This dev log focuses on `alpha-3.0` new
renderer, its past and future.

Another snõwkit [article][l2], this time by [Espen Breivik][tw2], which is a
proof of concept _“using hscript to program entity behaviours in luxe”_. I enjoy
posts like this, as Espen has gone into detail of modifying hscript, the problems
and solutions he worked through. It's one of the more longer posts on snõwkit, but
still an interesting read.

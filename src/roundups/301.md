# Haxe Roundup № 301<br/>Happy New Year!

After a short break from writing the roundup, lets get started with all the new 
library releases.

[Hugh Sanderson][tw1] started the new year by releasing NME `5.2.7`, NME `dev-1.3.5`
Waxe `3.1.1` and GM2D `3.2.5`. The majority of changes appear in NME, afew of them
being that NME is fully separated from Lime, building with MinGW is now possible and
the text rendering has been reworked. You can find more detailed info in the 
[annoucement][l2] post.

HxScout which has been mentioned frequently in past roundups, has been released to
the general Haxe and AS3 communities. With the [new website][l1] by [Jeff Ward][tw2] 
providing pre-built binaries for Windows, OSX and Linux, both communities now have
an in-progress open source alternative to Adobe Scout.

[Carlos Ballesteros Velasco][gh1] has created native [bindings][l3] to [Cairo][l7]
which _“produces consistent output on all output media while taking advantage of 
display hardware acceleration”_.

[Jeremy Sachs][tw3] has released version `1.2` of his [Golems][l4] library to 
[haxelib][l6] and GitHub. Golems is a _“macro backed, simple cross-platform Haxe 
worker system with its goal is to make it easier for developers to benefit 
from Haxes targets concurrency features”_. The `1.2` release fixes afew issues here 
and there, with the GitHub README greatly improved.

[Justin][gh2] and [Giuseppe Di Mauro][gh3] have teamed up to work on [hxDaedalus][l5]
which is a port of the AS3 version. HxDaedalus _“manages 2D environment modeling 
and pathfinding”_ with a focus on speed and accuracy.

The library compiles to Flash, JavaScript, Java and with the aid of NME or OpenFL
can run on any of their supported platform targets. With it being able to compile
to JavaScript you can view three of its demos, [Basic][l8], [Pathfinding][l9] and
[Maze][l10].

[Lubos Lenco][tw4] has been busy [porting][l13] the file format [OpenGEX][l11] 
which is a _“text-based file format designed to facilitate the transfer of 
complex scene data between applications such as modeling tools and game engines”_,
so it can be used in his game framework [Fox][l12] _“a game framework that 
integrates Blender and Kha into one experience”_.

And it seems the first third party Fox powered [demo][l14] has been created by 
[Devin Curry][tw5].

[Tilman Schmidt][tw6] has once again created a demo, which is very suitable for 
New Year's, the CPU particle [fireworks sim][l15] powered by [luxe engine][l16].

[Nico][tw7] has teamed up with [Compost Face][tw8] who created the sweet visuals
in the mock below, powered by luxe engine.

Another luxe engine [demo][l17] has been created by [Darek Greenly][tw9] whos
[impressed][l18] at the speed he is able to progress by using snõwkit.

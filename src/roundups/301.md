# Haxe Roundup № 301<br/>Happy New Year!

After a short break from the roundups, lets get started with all the new library
releases.

[Hugh Sanderson][tw1] started the new year by releasing NME `5.2.7`, NME `dev-1.3.5`
Waxe `3.1.1` and GM2D `3.2.5`. See more detailed info in the [annoucement][l2] post.

HxScout which has been mentioned frequently in past roundups, has been released to the
general Haxe and AS3 communities. With the [new website][l1] by [Jeff Ward][tw2] 
providing pre-built binaries for Windows, OSX and Linux, both communities now have
an in-progress open source alternative to Adobe Scout.

[Carlos Ballesteros Velasco][gh1] has created native bindings to [Cairo][l3].

[Jeremy Sachs][tw3] has released version `1.2` of his [Golems][l4] library to haxelib
and GitHub.

[Justin][gh2] and [Giuseppe Di Mauro][gh3] have teamed up to work on [hxDaedalus][l5].

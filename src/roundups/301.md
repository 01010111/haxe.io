# Haxe Roundup № 301<br/>Happy New Year!

After a short break from writing the roundup, lets get started with all the new 
library releases.

[Hugh Sanderson][tw1] started the new year by releasing NME `5.2.7`, NME `dev-1.3.5`
Waxe `3.1.1` and GM2D `3.2.5`. The majority of changes appear in NME, a few of them
being that NME is fully separated from Lime, building with MinGW is now possible and
the text rendering has been reworked. You can find more detailed info in the 
[announcement][l2] post.

HxScout which has been mentioned frequently in past roundups, has been released to
the general Haxe and AS3 communities. With the [new website][l1] by [Jeff Ward][tw2] 
providing pre-built binaries for Windows, OSX and Linux, both communities now have
an in-progress open source alternative to Adobe Scout.

[Carlos Ballesteros Velasco][gh1] has created native [bindings][l3] to [Cairo][l7]
which _“produces consistent output on all output media while taking advantage of 
display hardware acceleration”_.

[Jeremy Sachs][tw3] has released version `1.2` of his [Golems][l4] library to 
[haxelib][l6] and GitHub. Golems is a _“macro backed, simple cross-platform Haxe 
worker system with its goal is to make it easier for developers to benefit 
from Haxes targets concurrency features”_. The `1.2` release fixes a few issues here 
and there, with the GitHub README greatly improved.

[Justin][gh2] and [Giuseppe Di Mauro][gh3] have teamed up to work on [hxDaedalus][l5]
which is a port of the AS3 version by [Flash Cedric][l19]. HxDaedalus 
_“manages 2D environment modeling and pathfinding”_ with a focus on 
speed and accuracy.

The library compiles to Flash, JavaScript, Java and with the aid of NME or OpenFL
can run on any of their supported platform targets. With it being able to compile
to JavaScript you can view three of its demos, [Basic][l8], [Pathfinding][l9] and
[Maze][l10].

[Lubos Lenco][tw4] has been busy [porting][l13] the file format [OpenGEX][l11] 
which is a _“text-based file format designed to facilitate the transfer of 
complex scene data between applications such as modeling tools and game engines”_,
so it can be used in his game framework [Fox][l12] _“a game framework that 
integrates Blender and Kha into one experience”_.

And it seems the first third party Fox powered [demo][l14] has been created by 
[Devin Curry][tw5].

![fox demo](/img/301/fox_demo.mp4 "Fox Demo by @Devination3D")

[Tilman Schmidt][tw6] has once again created a demo, which is very suitable for 
New Year's, the GPU particle [fireworks sim][l15] powered by [luxe engine][l16].

[Nico][tw7] has teamed up with [Compost Face][tw8] who created the sweet visuals
in the mock below, powered by luxe engine.

![luxe mock](/img/301/nico_demo.mp4 "Luxe engine demo by @nico_m__ and @orbitantlers")

Another luxe engine [demo][l17] has been created by [Darek Greenly][tw9] whose been
[impressed][l18] at the speed he is able to progress by using snõwkit.

Moving away from demos to releases, which there has been quite a few over the
holiday.

[Caribou][tw13] has created [PODStream][l32] which will _“serialize and deserialize 
your fields to and from a ByteArray”_ using the power of macros and metadata.

[Vadim][gh4] has created a _“program that aids in making actual (TTF) pixel fonts 
from images”_ using Haxe and his alternative OpenFL HTML5 backend 
[open-bitfive][l20]. Head over to Vadim's site to read 
[Introducing BitFontReader][l21] and consider supporting him through [Patreon][l22].

The 3D [Worlds of Namide 3][l23] by [Namide][l24] was created using Haxe and the
[Heaps][l25] library. You are able to choose to run the art through Flash or WebGL. 
Its a beautiful piece of generative art, definitely take a look at it.

[Ben Merckx][tw11] of [Expansion RTS][l27], a _“real-time space strategy game for 
mobile, desktop and browsers featuring an intuitive and simple interface for a 
flawless gaming experience”_ will be released [soon][l28] and uses Haxe and OpenFL.

[Friendly Cat][l29] have released Pink Birds, a game with the goal of shooting the
pink birds, not the blue ones, has been released to the [Google Play Store][l30] and
the [App Store][l31].

[Mu Complex Episode One][l41] created by [StudioCime][l42] and [PND][tw20], the 
lead developer using on Haxe. With over 225k plays since its release back in
November, Mu Complex is a successful puzzle game requiring skill
and a ... computer.

[Jonas Nyström][tw10] has released a [UFront Playground][l26] which allows you
_“to find out what's possible when it comes to isomorphic solutions (same code on 
client and server)”_.

[Franco Ponticelli][tw14] has written a great explanation on what Haxe Abstracts are
and what's their _proper_ use over on [StackOverflow][l33]. While on the topic of
Haxe Abstracts, [Francesco Agati][tw15] has created an Abstract wrapping jQuery
with operator overloading [included][l34].

Both [Mark Knol][tw16] and [Vadim][gh4] seem to have had the same idea, to
create the Haxe logo through `try.haxe.org` for both supported targets, JavaScript
and Flash. Checkout Mark's [version][l35] and Vadim's [version][l36].

The team over at [Happy Technologies][tw17] have written 
[WebApp Component Oriented Programming][l37] in which they talk about using Haxe
and AngularJS together.

[Ashes][tw18] has written the article [Animated GIFs in HaxeFlixel][l38] which
uses [YAGP][l39] to have large animated backgrounds display on mobile devices.

[Peter Boyer][tw19] has started porting [verbnurbs.com][l40] to Haxe. Verb
is _“a JavaScript library for creating and manipulating NURBS surfaces and
curves in the browser or node.js”_.

I'll finish this monolithic roundup with a video from [Joshua Granick][tw12], OpenFL's
New Year update and the plan moving forward.

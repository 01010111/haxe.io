# Haxe Roundup № 226

[Infognition][l1] have written a great post titled [From native code to browser:
Flash, Haxe, Dart or asm.js?][l2] in which Dee Mon tests Flash, Dart and asm.js 
in a computation intensive task, the decompression of a key frame to RGB24.

[Mark Knol][tw1] has, single handedly brought the design of [try.haxe.org][l3]
up todate with Haxe's `3.0` redesign. Mark has also added a bunch of ready to run
examples demostrating the language, its powerful type system and more. 
[Clément Charmet][tw2] the original creator of [try.haxe.org][l3] has updated
the site to run off of Haxe `3.1.3`, the current stable version.

[Ryusei Yamaguchi][tw3], author of [unifill][l4] which provides cross-platform
unicode support has written [HxRE][l5] which is a pure Haxe implementation of
an regular expression engine, based on `libregex`. I think this is pretty cool.

[Yoshimura Yuu][tw4] has started porting [jsbn][l6] the _“fast, portable 
implementation of large-number math in pure JavaScript, enabling public-key 
crypto and other applications on desktop and mobile browsers”_ to Haxe, called
[hxbn][l7]. Another one to keep an eye on.

[Michel Käser][tw5] has continued to improve upon his set of `abstract` that
help you work with `bit` and `bytes` by implementing operator overloading for
all known bitwise operations. You can find all of these abstacts in Michel's
[hext][l8] repository.

Not only is [Lubos Lenco][tw6] working on his Blender to Kha framework `^`, he has
also ported the JigLib 3D physics engine to Haxe, called [JigLibHX][l9].

[Philippe Elsass][tw7] continues to introduce Haxe features and concepts to JavaScript
developers, this time in the [post][l10] Working with JavaScript libraries, in which
he shows you how to disabled the compilers type checking for a chunk of code,  how to
insert raw JavaScript and writing type definitions for existing JavaScript libraries.

A library that Philippe mentions in his post, which has recently been released is
[Mithril-hx][l11] by [Andreas Söderlund][tw8]. _“Mithril is a nice little 
JavaScript MVC framework with lots of power under the hood”_, combined with 
the power of Haxe's macro system.

![quaxe native html](/img/226/quaxe.png "HTML to Native using Quaxe and Waxe by @glazou")

[Daniel Glazman][tw9] has [added][l12] events, event listeners and event 
dispatching to his Quaxe library, which compiles HTML and CSS to native code.

# Haxe Roundup № 226

[Infognition][l1] have written a great post titled [From native code to browser:
Flash, Haxe, Dart or asm.js?][l2] in which Dee Mon tests Flash, Haxe, Dart and asm.js 
in a computation intensive task, the decompression of a keyframe to RGB24.

[Mark Knol][tw1] has, single handedly brought the design of [try.haxe.org][l3]
up to date with Haxe's `3.0` redesign. Mark has also added a bunch of ready to run
examples demonstrating the language, its powerful type system and more. 
[Clément Charmet][tw2] the original creator of [try.haxe.org][l3] has updated
the site to run off of Haxe `3.1.3`, the current stable version.

[Ryusei Yamaguchi][tw3], author of [unifill][l4] which provides cross-platform
unicode support has written [HxRE][l5] which is a pure Haxe implementation of
an regular expression engine, based on `libregex`. I think this is pretty cool.

[Yoshimura Yuu][tw4] has started porting [jsbn][l6] the _“fast, portable 
implementation of large-number math in pure JavaScript, enabling public-key 
crypto and other applications on desktop and mobile browsers”_ to Haxe, called
[hxbn][l7]. Another one to keep an eye on.

[Michel Käser][tw5] has continued to improve upon his set of `abstract` that
help you work with `bit` and `bytes` by implementing operator overloading for
all known bitwise operations. You can find all of these abstracts in Michel's
[hext][l8] repository.

![ios blender kha social](/img/226/ios_blender_kha.jpg "Blender and Kha iOS test running smooth at 60fps by @luboslenco")

Not only is [Lubos Lenco][tw6] working on his Blender to Kha framework `^`, he has
also ported the JigLib 3D physics engine to Haxe, called [JigLibHX][l9].

[Philippe Elsass][tw7] continues to introduce Haxe features and concepts to JavaScript
developers, this time in the [post][l10] Working with JavaScript libraries, in which
he shows you how to disabled the compilers type checking for a chunk of code,  how to
insert raw JavaScript and writing type definitions for existing JavaScript libraries.

A library that Philippe mentions in his post, which has recently been released is
[Mithril-hx][l11] by [Andreas Söderlund][tw8]. _“Mithril is a nice little 
JavaScript MVC framework with lots of power under the hood”_, combined with 
the power of Haxes macro system.

![quaxe native html](/img/226/quaxe.png "HTML to Native using Quaxe and Waxe by @glazou")

[Daniel Glazman][tw9] has [added][l12] events, event listeners and event 
dispatching to his Quaxe library, which allows you to compile HTML and CSS 
to native code.

The Haxe tutorials started with Philippe's JavaScript plus Haxe guide, but theres
more:
	
[Adi Reddy Mora][tw10] introduces [Haxe default access modifiers and return types][l13]
giving a quick and easy to follow examples for anyone getting started with Haxe. Adi
also has written [Haxe string interpolation and StringTools][117], again providing
a gentle introduction to string interpolation and `StringTools`.

[Kirill Poletaev][tw11] has released two new HaxeUI tutorials, [Accordions in HaxeUI][l14]
and [ListView in HaxeUI][l15] further demonstrating HaxeUI's abilities. 

The next tutorial is from [Fiery Squirrel][tw12] showing you [How to create an 
extension for Haxelib][l16].

[Boyan Ololoevich][tw13] has mentioned he will post new videos every Tuesday
demonstrating features for the IntelliJ IDEA Haxe plugin. Below you can watch
Boyan show you how to develop custom actions for the Haxe plugin.

![youtube](-mY_DpzVDFs)

[Tim Stoddard][tw14] has released the [source][l18] to his [Procedural Noise
Algorithms][l19], available from itch.io. The source includes midpoint displacement,
value noise and worley noise examples.

[Franco Ponticelli][tw15] has created a flocking simulation [demo][l20] called
[boidz][l21] using his [Sui][l22] library, the _“Simple User Interface: HTML + Haxe”_.

To finish up this roundup, [Sven Bergström][tw16] has written [Sublime Plugin 
updates][l23] which improves the snõwkit and luxe engine autocompletion in
Sublime Text.

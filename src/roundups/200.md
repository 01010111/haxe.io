# Haxe Roundup № 200

[Lars Doucet][gh1] has released his light weight localization library [Fire Tongue]
onto [haxelib][lib1]. The github [repository][fire tongue] README file is full of 
setup instructions, asset setup, formatting instructions, a [yoda-ish][l1] advanced use
guide, HaxeFlixel UI integration and more.

Lars has also written about [Defenders Quest 2 Engine Progress - Resolution!][l2] in
which he states how much effort he is putting into HaxeFlixel UI to get the user
interface to scale properly all the way up to 1080p, as DQ1 was hard locked at 800x600.

[Last week][l3] I linked to the HaxeFlixel [Game Mechanic Explorer][l4], which
this week has been updated with a series of [Bullet][l5] and [Spaceship Motion][l6]
examples.

[Lubos Lenco][tw1] has created and published a frame animation [demo][l7] written in Haxe
using the Kha framework.

And the [Haxor Engine][tw2] has a new demo, the [Dungeon Demo][l8] which has _“gizmos”_
on keys 1-5, `X` toggles FXAA and `Z` turns fog on or off.

The [Boltmade][tw3] team have written the article [Android Development: Beyond Java][l9]
in which they tested the waters by using Haxe to compile down to Java in a simple app.
Even though they were happy with the results they ended up translating the app back
to Java for the client.

[Andy Li][gh2] continues to improve Haxes syntax highlighting across the web by
maintaining the Haxe highlighter in [Pygments][l10] which is responsible for
Github's and Bitbucket's syntax highlighting.

And with the recent news that TravisCI now supports OSX through their multi-os 
beta feature Andy Li is working on getting Haxe and HXCPP to build successfully
on OSX.

And to finish up, [Mark Knol][tw4] and his team have released [AHH][l11] which is 
their latest Flambe project, which runs very smooth. It should definitely go into
the Flambe showcase. Great work.

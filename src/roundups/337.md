# Haxe Roundup № 337

[Franco Ponticelli][tw1] has posted that [Pellucid Analytics][l2], located in Boulder,
Colorado, USA, are [looking for a Senior Software Engineer][l1] to join the team. 
Knowing Haxe **will** be a big plus.

The Raxe project, a Ruby _inspired syntax_ that transpiles too Haxe, has been
recieving alot of attention and development this last week. [Tomas Slusny][tw2]
has [open sourced Raxe][l3], added a [cli tool][l4], gained its own
[Atom.io syntax][l5], **both** created by [Axel Anceau][tw3], has some [examples][l6]
and got its own article, [The perfect syntax, (almost)][l7].

Oh, it also got an [update website][l8], and new logo.

If a Ruby inspired Haxe transpiler wasn't good enough news, then how about 
[Oleg's][tw4] ongoing goal to make the Haxe compiler source be written in Haxe
instead of OCaml? Yeah, sounds _**interesting**_ right! Oleg has the current,
automatically converted, non-compiling [source code available on GitHub][l9].

For the last week, the OpenFL team have been closing issues on Lime and OpenFL left,
right and center, which has led to the release of [Lime `2.6.6`][l10] and 
[OpenFL `3.3.6`][l11], both available now from HaxeLib.

For Lime, _which affects OpenFL as well_, here's a taster of [what's new][l12]:
	
- Added initial accelerometer support
- Improved dirty logic with Image pixel operations
- Changed cURL bindings to use Bytes instead of String for callbacks
- Updated System.exit to go to background on Android if not an error
- Improved automatic garbage collection for native references

And some OpenFL [changes][l13]:
	
- Fixed alpha blending on iOS
- Improved support for native URLLoader GET/POST
- Improved support for native URLLoader binary data
- Integrated new improvements to the Stage3D context
- Fixed sound transform balance on HTML5 _(some browsers)_
- Reduced allocations made in the Graphics and TextField classes

Last week, [Patrick Gutlich][tw5] posted a video of OpenFL running with hardware acceleration
on a Raspberry Pi 2, this week, he has [written how to do it yourself][l14].

[Derico][tw6] has created an OpenFL Android extension, [available on GitHub][l15],
which integrates Google Analytics into your app. If you've used [Haxe GA][l16]
and wondering what's the difference in functionality, Derico's GA extension stores
data while the device is offline, while Haxe GA does not.

Derico also this week published [Diskoteka][l19] onto the Google Play Store, built
with HaxeFlixel. In Diskoteka you _“jump on the blocks, collect stars, and 
try to go as far as possible in this simple colorful game”_. Derico has also
written a brief development article, [Diskoteka - the game][l20].

[Haza][tw7] from SpringRoll Interactive has published [bioDigit][l17] to the
Google Play Store, which was created with HaxeFlixel. BioDigit is _“a fast 
paced arcade shooter game in which you control a group of **one-eyed spiders** 
to shoot down flying creatures of darkness with your **lightning strikes**!”_
You can also play it on [Newgrounds][l18] if you don't have an Android device.

[Sira Tama][tw9] has written an [article][l23][Jp] that shows off two tools built
with Haxe, an frame animation [exporter][l25] and [importer][l24]. In the included
demo video, you can see Photoshop export position and opacity information which is
then imported into Flash Pro.

[Mixer][tw8] has been incredibly busy this last week by releasing _**four**_
HaxeFlixel Planet Defence YouTube tutorial videos!

- [How to make a Planet Defence game #3 - Player controls and sprites][l21-67]
- [How to make a Planet Defence game #4 - Adding enemies][l21-19]
- [How to make a Planet Defence game #5 - Bullets killing enemies][l21-10]
- [How to make a Planet Defence game #6 - Turrets!][l22-19]

The FGL staff had a QA twitch steam, in which they talk about making money and
they [mention Haxe and OpenFL][l26] as a great solution for traditional Flash 
developers to  look into due to the benefits it offers to publish to many 
platforms.

[Tiago][tw10] has updated [dconsole][l27], a _“game-like console that provides 
runtime access to methods, variables and more”_, has added luxe engine support.

Two modular solutions for Haxe JavaScript popped up this last week.

- The first from [Timothy Farrel][gh1] who has created the library [modular-js][l28]
available from HaxeLib, which is _“a toolkit to export Javascript-target Haxe to 
Javascript (AMD) modules”_.
- The second is from [Philippe Elsass][tw11], _who makes FlashDevelop_, has
created the [Modular Haxe JS][l29] repository over on GitHub, which demonstrates
the _“creation of a Haxe-JavaScript modular project with on-demand loading of 
modules (JS + CSS)”_.

Philippe and the Massive Interactive team have updated [munit][l30], releasing
version `2.1.2`. If you don't know what munit is, _or guess by its name_,
**m**unit is _“a cross platform unit testing framework for Haxe with metadata
test markup and tools for generating, compiling and running tests from the 
command line”_. For all the details on what's new and fixed, checkout the
[changelog][l31].

Also recently, [Adi Reddy Mora][tw12] released version `3.0.21`
of PixiJS externs, available now from [HaxeLib][l32].

[Midori Kocak][tw13] has released another Haxe repository, which this time
demonstrates [different design patterns][l33] implemented in Haxe, _of course_, based
on the examples found at [Tutorials Points Design Patterns][l34].

[Matthijs Kamstra][tw14] is at it again this last week, updating the [HaxeNode][l35]
tutorial site with two new examples on using [Express][l36] and [NeDB][l37]. It's
**packed** full of great examples!

[Haxor Engine][tw15] a while ago published their version of the [Bunny Mark][l38]
benchmark, and its pretty _damn_ fast. They recently got their benchmark onto
[Chrome Experiments][l39]!

And we will finish this week's roundup off with two libraries from [Franco][tw1],
[thx.csv][l40] and [thx.format][l41], updated to version `0.1.1` and `0.5.1`
respectively. Checkout the other `thx.*` libraries on [thx-lib.org][l42] for more 
information.

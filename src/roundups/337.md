# Haxe Roundup № 337

[Franco Ponticelli][tw1] has posted that [Pellucid Analytics][l2], located in Boulder,
Colorado, USA, are [looking for a Senior Software Engineer][l1] to join the team. 
Knowing Haxe **will** be a big plus.

The Raxe project, a Ruby _inspired syntax_ that transpiles too Haxe, has been
recieving alot of attention and developement this last week. [Tomas Slusny][tw2]
has [open sourced Raxe][l3], added a [cli tool][l4], gained its own
[Atom.io syntax][l5], **both** created by [Axel Anceau][tw3], has some [examples][l6]
and got its own article, [The perfect syntax, (almost)][l7].

Oh, it also got an [update website][l8], and new logo.

If a Ruby inspired Haxe transpiler wasnt good enough news, then how about 
[Oleg's][tw4] ongoing goal to make the Haxe compiler source be written in Haxe
instead of OCaml? Yeah, sounds _**interesting**_ right! Oleg has the current,
automatically converted, non-compiling [source code available on GitHub][l9].

For the last week, the OpenFL team have been closing issues on Lime and OpenFL left,
right and center, which has led to the release of [Lime `2.6.6`][l10] and 
[OpenFL `3.3.6`][l11], both available now from HaxeLib.

For Lime, _which affects OpenFL as well_, heres a tastes of [whats new][l12]:
	
- Added initial accelerometer support
- Improved dirty logic with Image pixel operations
- Changed cURL bindings to use Bytes instead of String for callbacks
- Updated System.exit to go to background on Android if not an error
- Improved automatic garbage collection for native references

And some OpenFL [changes][l13]:
	
- Fixed alpha blending on iOS
- Improved support for native URLLoader GET/POST
- Improved support for native URLLoader binary data
- Integrated new improvements to the Stage3D context
- Fixed sound transform balance on HTML5 _(some browsers)_
- Reduced allocations made in the Graphics and TextField classes

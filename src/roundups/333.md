# Haxe Roundup № 333

![evoland 2 haxe nicolas cannasse shiro social](/img/333/evoland2.jpg "Evoland 2 concept art from Shiro Games")

Let's start this week's roundup off with three more videos from this year's
WWX2015 provided by the [Silex Labs][tw1] team.

- [HXCPP state of the ~~union~~ enum][l1] by [Hugh Sanderson][tw2]
- [Haxe in the Enterprise: A Case Study][l2] by Alfred Barberena
- [Quaxe, infinity and beyond][l3] by [Daniel Glazmen][tw3]

I've followed Daniel's announcements about Quaxe from the start, as having
HTML and CSS Haxe implementations, _especially by a W3C member_, are hugely useful
to the Haxe community, _and_ it doesn't rely on regular expressions, which is a bonus.

As for Daniel's comments, considering he was ill, which _usually_ means your
tact has diminished, it wasn't as bad as I was lead to think. Also Daniel's comments
where the catalyst for a [highly opinionated off topic thread][l4]
a few weeks back.

With Daniel's 20 plus years of experience, with a lot coming from open source projects,
it would be unwise to ignore his advice.

[Someone Unknown][tw4] has started posting YouTube tutorials on OpenFL and Waxe,
so here are the latest four I've come across.

- [Embedded Text in OpenFL][l5]
- [Using CSV data and starting work on Camera's in OpenFL][l6]
- [Using Menus and Event Handlers in Waxe][l7]
- [Finishing up on Camera's in OpenFL][l8]

[Siratama][tw5] has written [Using GAFMedia with Haxe in Flash CC][l9][Jp] in which
, _I think_, Siratama has created a Flash CC extension utilising GAFMedia
to generate Haxe definitions for your art assets.

Over on the mailing list, [Robert Konrad][tw6] has brought up the idea to 
[create a suite of benchmarks][l10] to help out not only the various 
frameworks improve their performance, but also the standard library. I agree with
others in the thread, like [Robert][tw6] and [Hugh][tw7], who suggest that 
non framework related tests should be included, so the core compiler targets 
can be improved, benefiting everyone.

The [benchmark suite][l11] has been setup by 
[Dmitry Hryppa][tw8] resulting from the significant performance increase
[Robert][tw6] has achieved with Kha, now with [`408k` bunnies][l12], the fastest
framework currently tested, beating LibGDX by `105k` bunnies!

Also, OpenFL's previous surprisingly _bad_ score of `32k` bunnies for **native**
has increased to `103k`. Now that the source code is available, it can be
scrutinised and tested with your results pushed to the [benchmark suite][l13].

The Haxor engine was the first accepted pull request adding a test running
in the browser via WebGL. Before the pull request got accepted, I was able to
[achieve `430k`][l14] bunnies with the reported [top score being `525k`][l15] by 
[Tiago Ling Alexandre][tw9].

[Matthijs Kamstra][tw10] has created a website that will [teach you about
Haxe and NodeJS][l16], with some of the information based on a old
haXe website, updated of course and with new, additional content.

[Luca Messalira][tw11] has added further features to [haxe-watchify][l17] with
version `1.3.0`, adding a web monitor which is useful on a second monitor or for 
remote team members by reproducing the command line output in the
web page.

[Kevin Leung][gh1] has used [UFront][l18], a Haxe framework for writing isomorphic
apps, to build [What If Z][l19], a website that poses the question
_"What if you are a zombie survivor?"_. It turns out I would be a Kim-Jong-Un
styled, kitchen knife wielding, american football gear cladded 
[zombie survivor][l20].

[Andy Li][tw12] is scheduled to present [Haxe to JavaScript developers][l21]
on October the 15th at the London JavaScript Community's first **online** meetup.

Even though Ludum Dare 33 has come and gone, the [Rat King][tw13] created Haxe
type definitions for [Sosowski's][tw14] jAllegro, aptly named, 
[Haxe-jAllegro][l22].

An article from [Sven Bergström][tw15] posted over on the snõwkit community
site, titled [Ludumdate 33][l23], which is actually poorly titled because its
**packed** full new features, samples, releases, performance fixes **and** 
community developments, so its not completely Ludum Dare focused.

But that's not all from Sven, he has _also_ [released mínt][l24], a game and tool focused, 
minimal renderer **agnostic** UI library **for Haxe**. Read that again, _**for Haxe**_ -
this is a recurring theme through Sven's projects, how to improve Haxe, _not_
a single framework.

A _quick_ particle editor has been made for luxe engine using mínt, which you
can [try out now][l25] for yourselves.

A game that can take advantage of all the snõwkit collective additions is
[Shooter][l26] by [Jonathan Hirz][tw16], created with luxe engine, in which you shoot enemies, destroy
the environment and rebuild your terrain.

[Ian Harrigan][tw17] who's been working on HaxeUI version 2 _(which will be
renderer agnostic just like mínt, but with far more controls)_ has launched
the [HaxeUI FaceBook page][l27] **and** the [HaxeUI Patreon page][l28]. 
Recently with Ian's ongoing improvement of HaxeUI, he has added the
[Kha backend for HaxeUI][l29].

[Rafael Oliveira][tw18] has created [Mobile][l30], a library for Kha that
helps calculate a new resolution based on your default resolution, creating the
correct aspect ratio for your app.

[Lubos Lenco][tw19] has released [Spiral Ride for iOS][l31], made with Kha 
and ZBlend. You _should've_ seen or read about it before I've included
previews of it in lots of past roundups.

[Adi Reddy Mora][tw20] has published his first Haxe powered PixiJS game
to [Virgin Games][l32] which uses his PixiJS type definitions. Unfortunately
the game is **tablet only**, so you might get a `404` error if you try
it.

[Mark Knol][tw21] from Media Monk Games has created and launched 
[Tricky Titans][l33], which is a turn based local multiplayer game for the
**Google ChromeCast**.

The OpenFL team [announced on Twitter][l34] that Electronic Arts _“uses OpenFL and an
in house 3D engine to deliver the latest season of Madden NFL Mobile on iOS and
Android”_. How _awesome_ is that.

[Mike][tw22] has released his first HaxeFlixel game called 
[Planet Squares Inc][l35], published to itch.io and _currently_ available for
free!

The voting for the latest GBJAM is almost over, here are _three_ GBJAM games
that I've been made aware of, more most _likely_ exist.

- [Through][l38] by [Adrian K.][tw25] using HaxeFlixel
- [AXUO][l37] by [Pizza Makes Games][tw24] using HaxeFlixel
- [Wheres my dog?][l36] by [Eduardo Lopes][tw23]

[Djoker Soft][tw26] has forked [Hugh's][tw2] [wxWidgets bindings][l39] and adding some
missing interfaces, with or has planned OpenFL integration, _correct me if I'm
wrong_.

[Angular 2 Haxe][l40] by [Niall Weedon][tw27] has reached version `0.3.0` which adds
`alpha.34` support and _“extra build time goodness”_.

And to finish this week's, _late_, roundup is [Franco Ponticelli's][tw28]
new [try.thx-lib.org][l41] site, a custom fork of [try.haxe.org][l42] 
which shows you through various examples on how to use the `thx` libraries.

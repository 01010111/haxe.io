# Haxe Roundup № 333

![evoland 2 haxe nicolas cannasse shiro](/img/333/evoland2.jpg "Evoland 2 concept art from Shiro Games")

Lets start this weeks roundup off with three more videos from this years
WWX2015 provided by the [Silex Labs][tw1] team.

- [HXCPP state of the ~union~ enum][l1] by [Hugh Sanderson][tw2]
- [Haxe in the Enterprise: A Case Study][l2] by Alfred Barberena
- [Quaxe, infinity and beyond][l3] by [Daniel Glazmen][tw3]

I've followed Daniel's annoucements about Quaxe from the start, as having
HTML and CSS Haxe implementations, especially by a W3C member, are greatly useful
to the Haxe community, _and_ it does'nt rely on regular expressions.

As for Daniel's comments, considering he was ill, which _usually_ means your
tact has disminished, wasnt as bad as I was lead to think. Daniel's comments
where the catalyst for a [highly opinionated off topic thread][ll4]
afew weeks back.

With Daniel's 20+ years of experience, with alot coming from open source projects,
it would be unwise to ignore his advice.

[Someone Unknown][tw4] has started posting YouTube tutorials on OpenFL and Waxe,
so here are the latest four I've come across.

- [Embedded Text in OpenFL][l5]
- [Using CSV data and starting work on Camera's in OpenFL][l6]
- [Using Menus and Event Handlers in Waxe][l7]
- [Finishing up on Camera's in OpenFL][l8]

[Siratama][tw5] has written [Using GAFMedia with Haxe in Flash CC][l9][Jp] in which
, _I think_, Siratama has created a Flash CC extension, utilising GAFMedia,
to generate Haxe type definitions for yours art assets.

Over on the mailing list, [Robert Konrad][tw6] has brought up the topic to 
[create a suite of benchmarks][l10] to help out not only the various 
frameworks improve on performance, but also the Haxe compiler. I agree with
others in the thread, like [Robert][tw6] and [Hugh][tw7], who suggest that 
non framework relate tests should be included, so the core compiler targets 
can be improved, benefiting everyone.

The [benchmark suite][l11] has been setup and will be maintained by 
[Dmitry Hryppa][tw8], resulting from the significant performance increase
[Robert][tw6] has achieved with Kha, now with [`408k` bunnies][l12], the fastest
framework currently tested, beating LibGDX by `105k` bunnies!

Also, OpenFL's previous surprisingly _bad_ score of `32k` bunnies for **native**
has increased to `103k`. Now that the source code is available, it can be
scrutinised and tested, with your results pushed to the [benchmark suite][l13].

The Haxor engine was the first accepted pull request, adding a test running
in the browser via WebGL. Before the pull request was accepted, I was able to
[achieve `430k`][l14], with the reported [top score being `525k`][l15] by 
[Tiago Ling Alexandre][tw9].

[Matthijs Kamstra][tw10] has created a website that will [teach you about
Haxe and NodeJS][l16], with some of the information based on a really old
haXe website, updated of course and with new content.

[Luca Messalira][tw11] has add further features to [haxe-watchify][l17], with
version `1.3.0` adding a web monitor, useful on a second monitor or for 
remote team members by reproducing the command line output directly in the
web page.

[Kevin Leung][gh1] has used [UFront][l18], a Haxe framework for writing isomorphic
apps, to build [What If Z][l19], a website that poses the question
_"What if your are a zombie survivor?"_. It turns out I would be a Kim-Jong-Un
styled, kitchen knife welding, american football gear cladded 
[zombie survivor][l20].

[Andy Li][tw12] has been invited to present [Haxe to JavaScript developers][l21]
on October the 15th at the London JavaScript Community **online** meetup.

Even though Ludumdare 33 has come and gone, the [Rat King][tw13] create Haxe
type definitions for [Sosowski's][tw14] jAllegro, aptly named, 
[Haxe-jAllegro][l22].

An article from [Sven Bergström][tw15] posted over on the snowkit community
site, titled [Ludumdate 33][l23], which is actually poorly titled because its
**packed** full new features, samples, releases, performance fixes **and** 
community going ons.

But thats not all from Sven, he has _also_ [released mínt][l24], a game and tool focused, 
minimal renderer **agnostic** UI library **for Haxe**. Read that again, _for Haxe_,
this is a recuring quality through Sven's projects, how to improve Haxe, not
a specific framework.

A _quick_ particle editor has been made for luxe engine using mínt, which you
can [try out now][l25] for yourselfs.

A game that can take advantage of all these snowkit collective additions, is
[Shooter][l26] by [Jonathan Hirz][tw16], created with luxe engine, in which you shoot enemies, destroy
the  environment and rebuild your terrain.

[Ian Harrigan][tw17] who's been working on HaxeUI version 2, which will be
renderer agnostic like mínt, but with far more controls, has luanched
the [HaxeUI FaceBook page][l27] **and** the [HaxeUI Patreon page][l28]. 
Recently, Ian's ongoing improvement of HaxeUI, he has added the
[Kha backend for HaxeUI][l29].

[Rafael Oliveira][tw18] has created [Mobile][l30], a library for Kha that
helps calcuate a new resolution base on your default resolution, creating the
correct apsect ratio.

[Lubos Lenco][tw19] has released [Spiral Ride for iOS][l31], made with Kha 
and ZBlend. You _should've_ seen or read about it before, I've included
previews of it in lots of past roundups.

# Haxe Roundup № 333

![evoland 2 haxe nicolas cannasse shiro](/img/333/evoland2.jpg "Evoland 2 concept art from Shiro Games")

Lets start this weeks roundup off with three more videos from this years
WWX2015 provided by the [Silex Labs][tw1] team.

- [HXCPP state of the ~union~ enum][l1] by [Hugh Sanderson][tw2]
- [Haxe in the Enterprise: A Case Study][l2] by Alfred Barberena
- [Quaxe, infinity and beyond][l3] by [Daniel Glazmen][tw3]

I've followed Daniel's annoucements about Quaxe from the start, as having
HTML and CSS Haxe implementations, especially by a W3C member, are greatly useful
to the Haxe community, _and_ it does'nt rely on regular expressions.

As for Daniel's comments, considering he was ill, which _usually_ means your
tact has disminished, wasnt as bad as I was lead to think. Daniel's comments
where the catalyst for a [highly opinionated off topic thread][ll4]
afew weeks back.

With Daniel's 20+ years of experience, with alot coming from open source projects,
it would be unwise to ignore his advice.

[Someone Unknown][tw4] has started posting YouTube tutorials on OpenFL and Waxe,
so here are the latest four I've come across.

- [Embedded Text in OpenFL][l5]
- [Using CSV data and starting work on Camera's in OpenFL][l6]
- [Using Menus and Event Handlers in Waxe][l7]
- [Finishing up on Camera's in OpenFL][l8]

[Siratama][tw5] has written [Using GAFMedia with Haxe in Flash CC][l9][Jp] in which
, _I think_, Siratama has created a Flash CC extension, utilising GAFMedia,
to generate Haxe type definitions for yours art assets.

Over on the mailing list, [Robert Konrad][tw6] has brought up the topic to 
[create a suite of benchmarks][l10] to help out not only the various 
frameworks improve on performance, but also the Haxe compiler. I agree with
others in the thread, like [Robert][tw6] and [Hugh][tw7], who suggest that 
non framework relate tests should be included, so the core compiler targets 
can be improved, benefiting everyone.

The [benchmark suite][l11] has been setup and will be maintained by 
[Dmitry Hryppa][tw8], resulting from the significant performance increase
[Robert][tw6] has achieved with Kha, now with [`408k` bunnies][l12], the fastest
framework currently tested, beating LibGDX by `105k` bunnies!

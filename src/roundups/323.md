# Haxe Roundup № 323

Alot has happened since the WWX2015 event. The age old question of
_“when will Haxe get short lambda's”_ has been [asked again][l1],
now an after WWX tradition.

The thread lead turned into a discussion of a community fork, which
appeared as an agreesive gesture. But it already exists
through [Patrick Le Clec'h][tw1] Hacking Haxe project and work,
where he experimentally adds new features to the Haxe compiler,
demonstrating that it can be down _without_ macros.

One of Patrick's first experimentally additions **was** short 
lambda's, try it out on his [Hacking Hack Playground][l2].

Partick has also added a couple of new features to his dev
branch of Haxe.

- Nil Coalescing Operator `??` and Optional Chaining Operator `?.` [playground][l3].
- Singleton Object [playground][l4].

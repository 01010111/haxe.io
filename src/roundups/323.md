# Haxe Roundup № 323

![wwx2015 openfl consoles lars doucet](/img/323/wwx2015.jpg "Lars Doucet speaking at WWX2015 in Mozilla Paris")

Alot has happened since the WWX2015 event. The age old question of
_“when will Haxe get short lambda's”_ has been [asked again][l1],
now an WWX tradition.

The thread lead turned into a discussion of a community fork, which
appeared as an agreesive gesture. But it already exists
through [Patrick Le Clec'h][tw1] Hacking Haxe project and work,
where he experimentally adds new features to the Haxe compiler,
demonstrating that it can be down _without_ macros.

One of Patrick's first experimentally additions **was** short 
lambda's, try it out on his [Hacking Hack Playground][l2].

Partick has also added a couple of new features to his dev
branch of Haxe.

- Nil Coalescing Operator `??` and Optional Chaining Operator `?.` [playground][l3].
- Singleton Object [playground][l4].

A great project to come out of the lambda discussion is [Slambda][l6]
by [Andreas][gh1], _“pronounced "slam-da", stands for Short Lambda
[and is] a tiny library that enables lambda expressions for Haxe 
in a simple way”_.

The Haxe Foundation have been on a organising rampage with the
launch of their [Project Management][l5] repository on GitHub
discussing the foundations problems and future. Its also been
added to [thx.core][l7].

For more WWX2015 related info, checkout my article [WWX2015
Highlights][l8] covering the new HXCPP target Cppia, the amazing
features of Kha, Ufront - the **official** web framework for Haxe
and loads more.

Following [Robert's][tw2] [annoucement][l9] of Kha's Unity3D target,
[Sidar Talei][tw3] has posted a picture of [KhaPunk][l10] running
**natively** in Unity.

A framework mentioned in Robert's WWX2015 talk, [ZBlend][l12] by
[Lubos Lenco][tw5], a _“3D game engine that integrates into 
Blender”_ has released a new first person [demo][l13].

The [GameDuell][tw4] team have also continued their post WWX2015 
articles, releasing an in-depth [post][l11] on duell tool.

[Francesco Agati][tw6] has been on a article publishing sprint this
week, here are his articles.

- Riot.hx - Haxe wrapper for Riot [article][l14].
- Write isomorphic code with Haxe [article][l15].
- Use Haxe with Java [article][l16].
- The real isomorphic code [article][l17].
- Slambda - A nice lib for short lambda in Haxe [article][l18].
- Assignment destructuring in Haxe [article][l19].

[Nico May][tw7] has updated his web chat app [Aqueous Basin][l20] to support
private rooms, dynamic favicons and a homemade captcha system all built with 
[Abe][l21].

The [Shark Punch][tw8] team have officially released The Masterplan, now
available from [Steam][l22] made with OpenFL for Windows, OSX and SteamOS/Linux.

Another game on Steam, up for greenlight is [Mu Complex][l23] by [Studio Cime][tw9],
which has episodes 1 and 2 on [Kongregate][l24], is a puzzle game in which you will
become a _“full featured hacker”_.

_Another_ game release this week is [Zombie Bucket][l25] available from the
App Store by [Filip Loster][tw10] using OpenFL. Zombie Bucket is a _“fast-paced, 
pixel-art Arcade Match-3 Zombie Slasher”_.

[Leong Wai Yin][tw11] has release his latest HaxeFlixel [article][l26] on using
masks in HaxeFlixel. Its one of the longer tutorials written by Leong but still
interesting.

[Eiyeron Fulmincendii][tw12] has posted an [article][l27][fr] called Nonoluxe, which
is a cross-platform HTML5 puzzle game made with snõwkit and _“is inspired by existing
games like Picross DS”_. You can play the current version of the game [online][l28].

And if you _havnt_ seen it yet, heres HaxeFlixel's MODE demo on the WiiU.

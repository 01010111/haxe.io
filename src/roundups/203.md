# Haxe Roundup № 203

While I continue to work on the write up of WWX2014, which is insanely behind release, you
can browse the WWX2014 [photo collection][l1] to tide you over. You can then checkout
[Cristian Baluta's][tw5] photo [album][l6]. Then onto the SilexLabs [youtube] playlist of 
past WWX videos.

[Seifer Tim][tw1] has spent the last month writing a comprehensive 13+ part [tutorial][l2]
set for HaxeFlixel. Such a brilliant contribution to the community right there.

[NicoM1][gh1] has released [IceEntity][l3] `0.6.1` which makes use of the new OpenFL features
to allow scripting in your game at runtime.

[Alexander Hohlov][tw2], one of the original creators of HaxeFlixel, has written two
tutorials, Tilesheet rendering [part 1] and [part 2] which introduce the Tilesheet API
and how the HaxeFlixel render works, respectively.

[MoJaWorks][tw3], a duo from Sheffield who have released Drop Dead Z onto [Google Play][l4]
and [Amazon][l5] have written the article [Smooth] which is based on the one word review
by [Philippe Elsass][tw4], goes into how they got Drop Dead Z to run as smooth and 
optimised as possible. The tips are really helpful to newcomers to Haxe and OpenFL and
a good reminder to those who have been around for awhile now.

[Lars Doucet][gh2] has created and released [Crash Dumper][l7] which is a cross-platform
automated crash report generator for OpenFL applications with the ability to send
the logs to a server for further processing. As the library matures I can see this
being a must need library for most people.

[Lubos Lenco][tw6] has created another demo built with Kha of [skeletal animation][l8].

Haxe Studio `0.3.2` has been [released][l9] which has a few new features and bug 
fixes, including a new File Tree and a Plugin Manager.

There is another Haxe IDE being worked on by [Johannes Stein][tw7] which is going to
be web based only. I haven't found the source or a live version available yet.

If you're using OpenFL and have problems building for the C++ targets, [Tuomas Salmi][tw8]
has written [Resolving Haxe][l10] which fixes the error `error C2039: ‘blit’ : is not a member of ‘Array_obj<ELEM_>’ with[ ELEM_=unsigned char ]`.

[Vadim][tw9] continues to experiment, this time with polygon based directional lighting
in Haxe using OpenFL.

![haxe openfl polygon directional lighting](/img/203/polygon-lighting.mp4 "Polygon Directional Lighting")

[Oscar Sims][gh3] has created and released [nxColor] which is a colour manipulation library
which currently supports CIELch, CIELab, XYZ, RGB and HSB colour spaces and can convert
between them.

[Peter Stefcek][tw10] has released the [second] Genome2D devcast, discussing Nape
physics, custom renderers and 3D projection.

And to finish up, [David Mouton][tw11] has released [haxe npm] `0.1.7` which allows
you to install Haxe through NPM which comes bundled with a bunch of awesome libraries.

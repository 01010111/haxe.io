# Haxe Roundup № 341

This is going to be a small Haxe Roundup this week, let's get right into it.

[Darek Greenly][tw1] at the beginning of the week released [GrayScale dev log #3][l1]
in which Darek leads you through his luxe engine powered, GameBoy style game covering
player input and visuals, with a little peek at the internals, some in-progress
tools and more. Visually, it looks amazing.

Another in-progress game being created with luxe engine has been [previewed][l13]
over on Twitter by [Denn Powell][tw5].

[Leong Wai Yin][tw2] has started working on a 2D game engine for Kha, called
[wyngine][l2]. You can try out three demo games created with wyngine, [KhaPong][l3],
[Khasteroids][l4] and [KhaQuadTree][l5].

If you're stuck choosing a codename for your next project, how about using 
[Samuel Twidale's][tw3] [procedural name generator][l6], originally intended for 
naming roguelikes. And its [open source][l7].

[Lexah][l10], a fork of [Raxe][l11], has two demo apps already released, 
a [todo app][l8] and a [Ionic Framework app][l9]. I'm not familiar with either 
Lexah or Raxe, so I'm unsure what's the difference between them.

[Matthijs Kamstra][tw8] has added one more example to his HaxeJavaScript tutorial
site, exploring [`@:expose`][l17]. Matthijs has also created a new page which
separates the site into four [levels of difficulty][l18].

[Peter Boyer][tw4] has completely rewritten [verb][l12] by using Haxe. _“Verb is
a library for creating and manipulating NURBS surfaces and curves in many 
languages including JavaScript”_.

[David Mouton][tw6] from [Agence Happy][tw7], has released [keewi.io][l14], built
completely with Haxe, is _“a crowdfunding platform that allows everyone to customise
a garment in order to collect funds”_.

[Matthijs Kamstra][tw8] has been collaborating with the Haxe Foundation to create
official merchandise. Currently a white [mug][l15] and [t-shirt][l16], either black
or white are being finalized. With the release of [keew.io][l14], how about
joint venture with the HF?

[Tom Bebbington][tw9] has updated [hx-ffi][l19], an _“easy FFI [library] for 
accessing native shared libraries”_ without any wrappers. Apparently it uses a 
similar method to Java's JNA.

If you only care about targeting and building for C++, a new Windows, Linux and Mac 
native [clipboard library][l21] has been released by [Josu Igoa][tw10], with the 
intention that the library is a [linc][l20] library.

To finish this week's roundup off are the latest two videos from the last week, enjoy!

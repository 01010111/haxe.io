# Haxe Roundup № 341

This is going to be a small Haxe Roundup this week, let get right into it.

[Darek Greenly][tw1] at the beginning of the week released [GrayScale dev log #3][l1]
in which Darek leads you through his luxe engine powered, GameBoy style game covering
player input and visuals, with a little peak at the internals, some in-progress
tools and more. Visually, it looks amazing.

[Leong Wai Yin][tw2] has started working on a 2D game engine for Kha, called
[wyngine][l2]. You can try out three demo games created with wyngine, [KhaPong][l3],
[Khasteroids][l4] and [KhaQuadTree][l5].

If your stuck choosing a codename for your next project, how about using 
[Samuel Twidale's][tw3] [procedural name generator][l6], originally intended for 
naming roguelikes. And its [open source][l7].

[Lexah][l10], a fork of [Raxe][l11], has two demo apps already released, 
a [todo app][l8] and a [Ionic Framework app][l9]. I'm not familiar with either 
Lexah or Raxe, so I'm unsure what's the difference between them.

[Peter Boyer][tw4] has completely rewritten [verb][l12] by using Haxe. _“Verb is
a library for creating and manipulating NURBS surfaces and curves in many 
languages including JavaScript”_.

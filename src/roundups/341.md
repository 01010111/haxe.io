# Haxe Roundup № 341

This is going to be a small Haxe Roundup this week, let get right into it.

[Darek Greenly][tw1] at the beginning of the week released [GrayScale dev log #3][l1]
in which Darek leads you through his luxe engine powered, GameBoy style game covering
player input and visuals, with a little peak at the internals, some in-progress
tools and more. Visually, it looks amazing.

# Haxe Roundup № 329

![wwx2015 group](/img/329/wwx2015group.png "The WWX2015 Attendee's")

The [Silex Labs][tw1] team has started releasing the long awaited WWX2015 videos,
preceeded by the [Wrapping up WWX2015][l1] article, with the
event hosted in the beautiful Mozilla Paris offices.

> The WWX2015 brought together about **100** participants from **17** countries 
for 4 days of conferences and workshops and the famous Silex Labs festive 
evenings. More than **1500** people followed the live stream of the conference on 
`air.mozilla.org` and on the official website `wwx.silexlabs.org`. All of these 
people didn’t just sit there and watch, they also shout to the world their 
love for Haxe, with nearly **1800** tweets between Saturday and Sunday and a lot 
of photos. A truely great community!

Now for the two currently released recordings.

- [10 years of Haxe, 10 things I like][l2] by [Nicolas Cannasse][tw2]. _Thanks for the mention `;)`_
- [You don't know FlashDevelop, Tips and Future][l3] by [Philippe Elsass][tw3]

[Justin Donaldson][tw9] has luanched the [Seahx][l12], _Seattle + Haxe_, group.
Seahx _“is a small semi-regular meetup of Haxe developers in the greater 
Seattle area”_. Head over to the [mailing list thread][l13] for any possible 
future info.

[Jeff Ward][tw4] [announced][l5] the release of [hxScout][l4] `0.3.0` available for
download, which provides improved performance. Also you **no** longer need to
checkout Jeff's forked libraries because as of OpenFL `3.1.1`, telemetry 
support was added meaning it can be enabled with `-D telemetry`.

Since Jeff's announcement, [OpenFL][l6] `3.2` and [Lime][l7] `2.5.1` have been 
released, adding speed improvements and improved image support. These two libraries
have been downloaded for a *combined* `150k+` times.

[Fuz][tw5] recently came across an [old puzzle game][l8] he made with OpenFL, also
releasing the [source code][l9].

[Lethal RPG: War][l10] by [Ben Webb][tw6], is available on Steam, _“fully remastered
for 1080p”_ and created with OpenFL. It's currently `50%` off, which ends this Friday.

[Joshua Granick][tw7], lead dev of OpenFL, has uploaded the video embedded below,
showing _“how easy it is to use Adobe Flash CC and OpenFL to create rich projects 
for Flash, HTML5 and native platforms”_.

If your using a Lime, a lightweight unified API, or OpenFL, [Jérémy Faivre][tw8] 
has created [Atom-Lime][l11] which adds support for the Lime build tool.

[Ruari O'Sullivan][tw13], creator of Cardinal Quest 2, has published the
article [Three Platforms][l15], which is made with OpenFL.

Another game being built with OpenFL, and HaxeFlixel, is [The Wolf's Bite][l14]
created by [Eric Bernier][tw10], [Karen Teixeira][tw11] and [Dave Coughlin][tw12].

# Haxe Roundup № 329

![wwx2015 group](/img/329/wwx2015group.png "The WWX2015 Attendee's")

The [Silex Labs][tw1] team has started releasing the long awaited WWX2015 videos,
preceeded by the [Wrapping up WWX2015][l1] article, with the
event hosted in the beautiful Mozilla Paris offices.

> The WWX2015 brought together about **100** participants from **17** countries 
for 4 days of conferences and workshops and the famous Silex Labs festive 
evenings. More than **1500** people followed the live stream of the conference on 
`air.mozilla.org` and on the official website `wwx.silexlabs.org`. All of these 
people didn’t just sit there and watch, they also shout to the world their 
love for Haxe, with nearly **1800** tweets between Saturday and Sunday and a lot 
of photos. A truely great community!

Now for the two currently released recordings.

- [10 years of Haxe, 10 things I like][l2] by [Nicolas Cannasse][tw2]. _Thanks for the mention `;)`_
- [You don't know FlashDevelop, Tips and Future][l3] by [Philippe Elsass][tw3]

[Jeff Ward][tw4] [announced][l5] the release of [hxScout][l4] `0.3.0` available for
download, which provides improved performance. Also you **no** longer need to
checkout Jeff's forked libraries because as of OpenFL `3.1.1`, telemetry 
support was added meaning it can be enabled with `-D telemetry`.

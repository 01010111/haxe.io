# Haxe Roundup № 223

Papers, Please [back in May][l1] swept the IGF awards at GDC and on the 
29th October, Papers, Please the dystopian document thrill by [Lucas Pope][tw1] 
won the [GameCity 2014 Prize][l2], adding one more award to his [collection][l3].
Papers, Please is probably the most successful Haxe and NME/OpenFL powered game.

Over on the OpenFL blog, [Thomas Uster][tw2] is the first developer to be interviewed
in a new regular series of posts. In this first [Developer Spotlight][l4], Thomas
talks about [Pakka Pets][tw3], an in-development pet adventure game for your phone.

Game Sauce have written [Bronko Blue, the Kitten Copter: Feedback can be a lifesaver][l5]
in which [Katja Krone][tw4] and [Lars Quentmeier][tw5] talk about starting 
[Byte Combo][l6], their indie studio based in Berlin, the problem of feature creep,
encountering cross-platform issues and marketing.

And to celebrate Halloween there is now an Halloween edition of Bronko Blue, the Kitten
Copter available on [iTunes][l7], [Play Store][l8] and [Amazon][l9].

[Fiery Squirrel][tw12] have written [Fluff Eaters: The Journey][l16] is the story
behind how Fluff Eaters came about. Fluff Eaters has already been released to the
[Play Store][l17] with the iOS version still in development. The [website][l18] is
really well done.

There have also been a bunch of game releases this last week, in no
particular order, [Polaritron][l19] by [Leonardo Cavaletti][tw13] available for
Android, PC and Linux, [Farting Piggy][l10] by [Alonso Villicaña][tw6] for Android,
[Evaderon][l11] by [Christopher Jon][tw7] for iOS using HaxeFlixel, [LVRG][l12]
by [Kyle Travis][tw8] for Android using OpenFL, [Cursed Treasure 2][l13] by
[IriySoft][tw9] studio for iOS using OpenFL, [MU Complex][l14] by [StudioCime][tw10]
published to Kongregate and [Freefall][l15] by [Tschery][tw11] published to 
Deviant Art.

Lets move away from games now.

[Pah Arif][tw14] has published a [video][l20], embedded below, of a cross-platform
real time debugger, which I assume will be integrated into the [Haxe Studio][tw15]
IDE.

![youtube](QCgjx85YcEI)

[DConsole][l21], a _“Haxe game-like console that provides runtime access to methods, 
variables and more”_ supporting the Flash, Neko and CPP targets through OpenFL, has
recently had HTML5 support added by using `jquery-terminal` implemented by
[TiagoLr][gh1].

[Ian Harrigan][tw16] has added the ability to save and share Haxe UI layouts
from the Haxe UI [builders][l22] page. It was primarily designed to explain
bugs.

Ian has also added the ability for you to embed Haxe UI's version information
by using `Toolkit.versionInfo` which uses macros under the hood. The format is
identical to what you would find in any `haxelib.json` file.

[Eiyeron Fulmincendii][tw17] has posted to Snõwkit [Square: Effect Bonuses][l23], 
covering what's changed since his last post to Snõwkit.

[Tilman Schmidt][tw25] has published his isometric water [demo][l24] which I've
mentioned a few times. He has also released a `.ply` file [importer and exporter][l25]
for Luxe engine.

[Nico][tw18] has also been experimenting with Snõwkit, creating [Luxe Mesh][l26]
which is capable of creating swans.

![social swan](/img/223/swan.png "Luxe Mesh Swan by @nico_m__")

Switching back to OpenFL for a second, [Nick Grebenshikov][tw19] has added another
example to his list of OpenFL-SnapSVG examples. This time he has added 
a [Stablex UI demo][l27].

[Michel Käser][tw20] has written an [example][l28] which shows you how to use his
RetryHandler class.

[Alexander Kuzmenko][tw21] has written a proof of concept [library][l29]
that allows for null safety using the power of macro's.

[John Dimi][tw22] has created [CDCrush][l30]. He created it because he wanted to
save hard drive space where he kept CD images of Playstation and PCEngine games.
These images contain uncompressed audio, so by using todays audio codecs he is
able to get 400+MB images down to 40MB. John is using Haxe to compile to NodeJS.

[Jeff Ward][tw24] has released [WootMath][l31], a _“new hands on approach to 
teaching fractions”_. Jeff used Haxe to compile libraries into `swc` files, which
then got compiled to Air so they can reach Mobile and Web/Chromebook platforms.
Haxe provided faster compile times, fast execution speeds for intensive routines
and more.

And lets finish this weeks roundup off with a demo of asset reloading in 
OpenFL by [Yura Zatsepin][tw23].

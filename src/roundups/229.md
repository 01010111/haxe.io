# Haxe Roundup № 229

![papers please social](/img/229/papers.jpg "Papers, Please on iOS by @dukope")

[Jason Sturges][tw1] has written a new performance benchmark [post][l1] covering
float math, object instantiation, down casting, up casting, event dispatching, 
function overhead, function inlining, loops and finally `Graphic` drawing each compiled
to Neko, Flash, HTML5 and Native (OSX).

If your interested in running performance benchmarks yourself, Jason has written
a [tutorial][l2] on how to get started using his library [Performance Test][l3]. He
has modeled his library after Grant Skinner's ActionScript project which goes by the
same name.

Jason has also written the [tutorial][l4] OpenFL code documentation with Dox which 
shows you what libraries you will need and how to install them, to marking your code
with Dox specific metadata to actually generating documentation for your code.

Also this week [Adi Reddy Mora][tw2] has [written][l6] about installing and using 
`chxdoc` and  `yuidoc` as documentation generators for your Haxe projects.

[Fabricio][gh1] has written two articles explained new HIDE functionality. Both articles
are in Portuguese, so I may have completey misunderstood them.

The first [article][l5] shows via screen shots how to use Flambe, which is now 
natively supported in HIDE.

The second [article][l6] shows you how to get started with HIDE's builtin Gradle support
provided by Fabricio.

![luxe engine wireframe](/img/229/wireframe.png "3D wireframe project by @KeyMaster_")

[Ryan Davis][tw3] has been previewing new features he is implementing into his
[tannus][l7], [Pointer][l8], pointer assignment and pointer binding. Tannus is
a JavaScript focused Haxe library.

[Jonas Nyström][tw4] last week demoed his [Audio Mixer][l9] has started a new 
library called [HxAudioTools][l10] which attempts _“to create a toolbox for 
basic audio manipulation in Haxe”_. This is definitely a project to keep an eye on
as cross-platform audio has been a reacurring problem for Haxe frameworks.

[Paul Alexandrov][gh2] has created and released [YAGP][l11], his Yet Another Gif Parser
library. YAGP _“provides a simple API to parse animated GIF images. The difference 
between haxe-gif library, is that this library successfully parses most Gif 
images”_.

[Sira Tama][tw5] has released a new game to the Google Play Store called [Killvege][l12]
which uses Adobe AIR.

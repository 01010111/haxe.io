# Haxe Roundup № 229

![papers please social](/img/229/papers.jpg "Papers, Please on iOS by @dukope")

[Jason Sturges][tw1] has written a new performance benchmark [post][l1] covering
float math, object instantiation, down casting, up casting, event dispatching, 
function overhead, function inlining, loops and finally `Graphic` drawing, each compiled
to Neko, Flash, HTML5 and Native (OSX).

If you're interested in running performance benchmarks yourself, Jason has written
a [tutorial][l2] on how to get started using his library [Performance Test][l3]. He
has modeled his library after Grant Skinner's ActionScript project which goes by the
same name.

Platformer physics by [Nico M][tw9] using luxe engine.

Jason has also written the [tutorial][l4] OpenFL code documentation with Dox which 
shows you what libraries you will need and how to install them, to marking your code
with Dox specific metadata to actually generating documentation for your code.

Also this week [Adi Reddy Mora][tw2] has [written][l6] about installing and using 
`chxdoc` and  `yuidoc` as documentation generators for your Haxe projects.

[Fabricio][gh1] has written two articles explained new HIDE functionality. Both articles
are in Portuguese, so I may have completely misunderstood them.

The first [article][l5] shows via screen shots how to use Flambe, which is now 
natively supported in HIDE.

The second [article][l6] shows you how to get started with HIDE's built-in Gradle support
provided by Fabricio.

[Ryan Davis][tw3] has been previewing new features he is implementing into his
[tannus][l7] library, [Pointer][l8], pointer assignment and pointer binding. Tannus is
a JavaScript focused Haxe library.

[Jonas Nyström][tw4] last week demoed [Audio Mixer][l9] and this week has started a new 
library called [HxAudioTools][l10] which attempts _“to create a toolbox for 
basic audio manipulation in Haxe”_. This is definitely a project to keep an eye on
as cross-platform audio has been a reocurring problem for Haxe frameworks.

[Pavel Alexandrov][gh2] has created and released [YAGP][l11], his Yet Another Gif Parser
library. YAGP _“provides a simple API to parse animated GIF images. The difference 
between haxe-gif library, is that this library successfully parses most Gif 
images”_.

Follow the leader, an in-progress luxe engine project by [Christopher Jon][tw8].

[Sira Tama][tw5] has pointed out that [Cygames][l13], a Japanese game studio, has
released a new game to the Google Play Store called [Killvege][l12] compiled with
Haxe and deployed with Adobe AIR.

[Sven Bergström][tw6] has posted to the snõwkit community [LD31 Recap][l14]
which lists some Ludum Dare games which have been made with luxe engine. Also, remember
to submit your LD31 Haxe made game to the [LD31 Roundup Todo List][l15].

I'll finished with the latest video from [Boyan Ololoevich's][tw7] which shows
you how to get metadata completion in the IntelliJ IDEA Haxe plugin.

# Haxe Roundup № 331

Let's start off with a thread thats _just_ starting over on the mailing list,
with the outcome likely to affect **every** single Haxe developer using a
framework.

The thread is [Sharing between frameworks][l1], started by [Hugh Sanderson][tw1],
author of the HXCPP target, NME and father of OpenFL, proposes the following:
	
> So what I am proposing is defining a framework-neutral specification or a config
file plus a directory layout for this data.  The idea is that the individual 
framework tools can either convert this specification into its native format 
(.nmml/KhaMake whatever), or read the spec directly.  It may also require 
some code-gen (eg, generate hooks, maybe JNI calls). A slight variation on this 
would be add an additional "frameworks" directory where other frameworks can 
pull-request their custom build-files, but I think that this could be more work.

Three more WWX2015 video's have been posted online by the [Silex Labs][tw2] team:
	
- [Jive: The renovation of AsWing][l2] by Nickolay Grebenshikov
- [Kha][l3] by Robert Konrad
- [IDE choice at TiVo][l4] by Srikanth Ganapavarapu

Robert's talk is one of my favoriates from WWX2015, partly because I knew very 
little about Kha, the macro backed [networked multiplayer][l5] announcement, the
various underlying tools and _cheekily_ beating OpenFL to export to consoles 
via its new [export to Unity][l6] feature.

[Ian Harrigan][tw3] tweeted this week a picture of [HaxeUI's `v2` Flambe support][l7]
, showing scrollview support _“working as expected”_. Ian also mentions the next
two potential targets for HaxeUI support might be Kha and snõwkit.

There has been another high profile Flash developer switch to Haxe, [Bennet Foddy][tw4]
has ported [QWOP over to Haxe][l8] using luxe. Bennet has written up over on the
snõwkit community site [Porting QWOP from Flash to Luxe][l9].

> Browser hassles aside, this was a great experience. Luxe is still in alpha, 
but I **strongly** recommend it as a platform for porting games to HTML5 or native 
targets from other systems, and for writing 2D games in general. I don't think my
needs are unique: I want a flexible, powerful multiplatform engine that **builds 
small** and lets me work clean. Luxe is that.

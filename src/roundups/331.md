# Haxe Roundup № 331

Let's start off with a thread that's _just_ starting over on the mailing list,
with the outcome likely to affect **every** single Haxe developer using a
framework.

The thread is [Sharing between frameworks][l1], started by [Hugh Sanderson][tw1],
author of the HXCPP target, NME and father of OpenFL, proposes the following:
	
> So what I am proposing is defining a framework-neutral specification or a config
file plus a directory layout for this data.  The idea is that the individual 
framework tools can either convert this specification into its native format 
(.nmml/KhaMake whatever), or read the spec directly.  It may also require 
some code-gen (eg, generate hooks, maybe JNI calls). A slight variation on this 
would be add an additional "frameworks" directory where other frameworks can 
pull-request their custom build-files, but I think that this could be more work.

Three more WWX2015 video's have been posted online by the [Silex Labs][tw2] team:
	
- [Jive: The renovation of AsWing][l2] by Nickolay Grebenshikov
- [Kha][l3] by Robert Konrad
- [IDE choice at TiVo][l4] by Srikanth Ganapavarapu

Robert's talk is one of my favorites from WWX2015, partly because I knew very 
little about Kha, the macro backed [networked multiplayer][l5] announcement, the
various underlying tools and _cheekily_ beating OpenFL to export to consoles 
via its new [export to Unity][l6] feature.

[Ian Harrigan][tw3] tweeted this week a picture of [HaxeUI's `v2` Flambe support][l7]
, showing scrollview support _“working as expected”_. Ian also mentions the next
two potential targets for HaxeUI support might be Kha and snõwkit.

There has been another high profile Flash developer switch to Haxe, [Bennet Foddy][tw4]
has ported [QWOP over to Haxe][l8] using luxe. Bennet has written up over on the
snõwkit community site [Porting QWOP from Flash to Luxe][l9].

> Browser hassles aside, this was a great experience. Luxe is still in alpha, 
but I **strongly** recommend it as a platform for porting games to HTML5 or native 
targets from other systems, and for writing 2D games in general. I don't think my
needs are unique: I want a flexible, powerful multiplatform engine that **builds 
small** and lets me work clean. Luxe is that.

[Lars Doucet][tw6] is collecting information for an upcoming article he is working
and needs your help. If you're a Flash dev who moving or moved to Haxe, consider
filling in his form below.

Back in [issue № 324][l10], [Dmitry Hryppa][tw5] released his first set of BunnyMark
benchmark data in various framework implementations, OpenFL, Kha, MonoGame, XNA are
just some of them. He has released his latest set of [benchmarketing data][l11] which
now includes NME which completely _floors_ OpenFL. Between the two article releases
Kha has gone from `131K` to `200K`. Until Dmitry releases the source I expect something
_funky_ is going on with the OpenFL implementation, as these numbers are for **native**
performance and not for HTML5.

[Vadim][tw7] has for awhile now been tweeting previews of him using Haxe to generate
Pico8 code. Well, Vadim has released `hxpico8`, his new Haxe target. In his 
[Introducing HxPico8][l12] Vadim takes you through the reasoning behind creating the
`hxpico8` target, the technical challenges involving in its creation and concludes
with...

> `hxpico8` allows to leverage the **power** of Haxe for creating PICO-8 
applications while maintaining **control** over the output size and structure. 
The compiler permits various measures to be taken for optimizing output size 
and performance while keeping the actual source code tidy. A number of examples 
_(along with compiled files for comparison)_ can be found in the according 
repository.

[Niall Weedon][tw8] continues to improve [angular2haxe][l13] by recently adding
macros which I _assume_ process components at compile time, reducing run time
setup, and it's [now available from HaxeLib][l14].

[Timothy Farrel][gh1] has published two libraries for use with the Haxe JavaScript
target, [es6-externs][l15] and [es6-coretypes][l16]. `es6-externs` provides
type definitions for ES6 data structures and is used by `es6-coretypes`, which will
replace Haxe coretypes with ES6 compatible types, producing a smaller, cleaner
JavaScript output.

[Andy Li][tw9] has written an incredibly in-depth article on 
[TypeScript vs Haxe][l17], in which Andy does a great job comparing _nearly_ 
everything in both languages. One point that caught my attention, which I think
is a great idea and adds extra weight to his word, was that Andy took and completed
a MOOC course from edX titled [Introduction to TypeScript][l18].

Also a raytracer example from the TypeScript home page [was ported to Haxe][l20]
and posted to [try.haxe.org][l19] and when compiled to Haxe JavaScript renders twice
as fast as TypeScripts _“probably because [of the use of] abstracts and inlines”_.

Every library mentioned here can be used by [Haxe Watchify][l21] by 
[Luca Mezzalira][tw10] who has added a new feature, the ability to monitor
the build process from a remote browser, maybe on your phone?

[PeyTy's][tw11] Alt Haxe project, [apparently][l22] can tokenize _“1 million 
lines of code per second”_.

To finish this weeks roundup off, in [last week's issue][l23] we had Citrus Engine
state they are using Haxe for their JavaScript backend, now we have [Atomic Game
Engine use Haxe][l24] for the very same reason.

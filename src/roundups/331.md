# Haxe Roundup № 331

Let's start off with a thread thats _just_ starting over on the mailing list,
with the outcome likely to affect **every** single Haxe developer using a
framework.

The thread is [Sharing between frameworks][l1], started by [Hugh Sanderson][tw1],
author of the HXCPP target, NME and father of OpenFL, proposes the following:
	
> So what I am proposing is defining a framework-neutral specification or a config
file plus a directory layout for this data.  The idea is that the individual 
framework tools can either convert this specification into its native format 
(.nmml/KhaMake whatever), or read the spec directly.  It may also require 
some code-gen (eg, generate hooks, maybe JNI calls). A slight variation on this 
would be add an additional "frameworks" directory where other frameworks can 
pull-request their custom build-files, but I think that this could be more work.

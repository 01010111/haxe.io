# Haxe Roundup № 331

Let's start off with a thread thats _just_ starting over on the mailing list,
with the outcome likely to affect **every** single Haxe developer using a
framework.

The thread is [Sharing between frameworks][l1], started by [Hugh Sanderson][tw1],
author of the HXCPP target, NME and father of OpenFL, proposes the following:
	
> So what I am proposing is defining a framework-neutral specification or a config
file plus a directory layout for this data.  The idea is that the individual 
framework tools can either convert this specification into its native format 
(.nmml/KhaMake whatever), or read the spec directly.  It may also require 
some code-gen (eg, generate hooks, maybe JNI calls). A slight variation on this 
would be add an additional "frameworks" directory where other frameworks can 
pull-request their custom build-files, but I think that this could be more work.

Three more WWX2015 video's have been posted online by the [Silex Labs][tw2] team:
	
- [Jive: The renovation of AsWing][l2] by Nickolay Grebenshikov
- [Kha][l3] by Robert Konrad
- [IDE choice at TiVo][l4] by Srikanth Ganapavarapu

Robert's talk is one of my favoriates from WWX2015, partly because I knew very 
little about Kha, the macro backed [networked multiplayer][l5] announcement, the
various underlying tools and _cheekily_ beating OpenFL to export to consoles 
via its new [export to Unity][l6] feature.

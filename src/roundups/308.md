# Haxe Roundup № 308

![wwx 2015 social](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

This last week has had some pretty impressive posts, librarys and game releases.

[Sven Bergström][tw1] has written, to date, the single best description of Haxe is in 
his post [Haxe from 1000ft][l1].

> Haxe is an extremely versatile toolkit for cross platform and cross 
target development (more on this soon). It is a tool that fits many uses which 
by nature makes it very hard to pinpoint it to a list of "What is it" or 
"What is it for". It's difficult to say - because you can do basically 
anything using it.

Sven has single handedly written a comprehensive introduction to the Haxe toolkit,
giving concise descriptions of every part of the toolkit, the compiler, the language,
the standard libary, target specifics, the generated output and everything in between
and beyond. If you've been struggling to put Haxe in a box, you have to [read][l1]
Sven's post.

[Justin Donaldson][tw2] has started experiementing with a [new Haxe target][l2], with
a Ocaml backend, targeting Lua. It's early days, but this might result in [Oleg's][tw3]
[work][l3] being combined into Justin's Ocaml backend. It's one to watch.

[Dan Korostelev][tw4] has written [Please Haxe, give me Null Safety][l4]. Dan is part 
of the compiler team, but one thing that constantly bugs him it that there is basically
no null safety in Haxe.

> What I would like to see in Haxe 4 very much is strict separation between 
`T` and `Null<T>`, which means that one CANNOT assign or compare `T` with `null` 
AND one cannot implicitly unify `Null<T>` with `T`.

[Lars Doucet][tw5] has written [Game Maker, Security and Freedom][l5] in which
he warns people of relying too much on propriatory tools and promoting the
tools and frameworks built ontop and around Haxe.

> I've since joined the OpenFL team and we're currently working 
on extending OpenFL's CPP export functionality to support game 
console targets, but that's not done quite yet.

That statement isnt quite true any more as Lars has successfully gotten Lime / 
OpenFL [compiling and rendering][l6] on the WiiU.

And proof of Haxe's versatillity, [World Zombination][l7] has been released worldwide
on iOS which was possible because of Haxe and Unity3D working 
so well together. Congratulations to the [Proletariat Inc][tw6] team. Oh, here's
some [proof][l8] [they][l9] used Haxe and Unity3D.

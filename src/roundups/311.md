# Haxe Roundup № 311

![wwx 2015](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

The WWX 2015 team, [Silex Labs][tw1], have [launched][l1] their crowdfunding 
campaign which at the time of writing this roundup, stands at 36% funded. 

> Silex Labs is a non profit association in charge of the organization of the 
WWX since 2012. The purpose of this crowdfunding is to generate interest in 
the event, expand communication, attract sponsors and raise some funds to cover 
the balance of the event's costs which can’t be shouldered by Silex Labs 
alone anymore. As our partnership with Mozilla includes that the tickets for 
the conference should be free, we will start the ticket reservation once the 
first goal is achieved. All the backers will have pre-reserved seats.

So the conference _itself_ is free and will be hosted in a [very][l2] [beatiful][l3]
building. Its also a great way for those us who are not able to attend to contribute
to the conference, to get awesome recordings of all the talks!

So with Haxe version `3.2` being released [tomorrow][l4], _fingers crossed_, it was
great timing that [Dan Korostelev's][tw2] article [A Success Story for Haxe][l5] has
been on the front page of [Hacker News][l6] generating decent amounts of interest 
in Haxe's direction.

> The team was very happy to move from JavaScript (they hated it 
because they are mostly C# fans) to something well-typed and structured, 
and thanks to the compile-time checking, further development become much 
more stable and fast (less bugs -> less time spent on researching and fixing). 
Overall there are only benefits.

The [Atom.io][l7] IDE has two, in development, libraries maintained by the snõwkit
collective, [Haxe][l8] and [flow][l9] plugins. Another victory for 
[Sven Bergström][tw3] unifying Haxe contributors efforts into single repos.

The IntelliJ IDEA Haxe [plugin][l10] has also been updated to version `0.8.1.1.TiVo.4`
and available via the JetBrains plugin repository. Better handling of Haxe 3
language parsing and automatic detection of Haxe libraries are just two of the 
many changes, if your interested dig into the huge [Changelog][l11].

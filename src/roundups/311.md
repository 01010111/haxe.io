# Haxe Roundup № 311

![wwx 2015](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

The WWX 2015 team, [Silex Labs][tw1], have [launched][l1] their crowdfunding 
campaign which at the time of writing this roundup, stands at 38% funded. 

> Silex Labs is a non profit association in charge of the organization of the 
WWX since 2012. The purpose of this crowdfunding is to generate interest in 
the event, expand communication, attract sponsors and raise some funds to cover 
the balance of the event's costs which can’t be shouldered by Silex Labs 
alone anymore. As our partnership with Mozilla includes that the tickets for 
the conference should be free, we will start the ticket reservation once the 
first goal is achieved. All the backers will have pre-reserved seats.

So the conference _itself_ is free and will be hosted in a [very][l2] [beautiful][l3]
building. Its also a great way for those us who are not able to attend to contribute
to the conference, to get awesome recordings of all the talks!

So with Haxe version `3.2.0.rc.1` being released [tomorrow][l4], _fingers crossed_, it was
great timing that [Dan Korostelev's][tw2] article [A Success Story for Haxe][l5] has
been on the front page of [Hacker News][l6] generating decent amounts of interest 
in Haxe's direction.

> The team was very happy to move from JavaScript (they hated it 
because they are mostly C# fans) to something well-typed and structured, 
and thanks to the compile-time checking, further development become much 
more stable and fast (less bugs -> less time spent on researching and fixing). 
Overall there are only benefits.

The [Atom.io][l7] IDE has two, in development, libraries maintained by the snõwkit
collective, [Haxe][l8] and [flow][l9] plugins. Another victory for 
[Sven Bergström][tw3] unifying Haxe contributors efforts into single repos.

The IntelliJ IDEA Haxe [plugin][l10] has also been updated to version `0.8.1.1.TiVo.4`
and available via the JetBrains plugin repo. Better handling of Haxe 3
language parsing and automatic detection of Haxe libraries are just two of the 
many changes, if your interested dig into the huge [Changelog][l11].

There is also an FD5 branch on the FlashDevelop GitHub repo.

> FD should be able to pick Flambe or Flow config changes and update code 
completion accordingly. The system is extensible so you can integrate more 
3rd party build tools. Normally if you install FD5, open your Flow project 
and make sure the target is Flow in the project properties then everything 
should be automatic.

[Philippe Elsass][tw4] also [talks][l12] about some of the other FD5 features, 
high-dpi support, better Wine / CrossOver integration and more.

Philippe has also [posted][l13] that Massive Interactive has a job opening
for a Senior UI Engineer.

Another Massive Interactive employee, [David Peek][tw5] has created [hvm][l14],
the _“Haxe Version Manager for users of Bash”_.

[Accidental Rebel][tw6] has written [I created an AnimatedSprite Tool
for Flambe][l15] in which he [demonstrates][l16] his spritesheet support for his
inprogress game Pop Puff and Away. You can find the [source code][l17] to the tool
on GitHub.

[Namide][tw7] has freed the [Tetrominos Killer][l18] game from Facebook, which is
a _“platform game with a shower of tetrominos. Avoid them and pick up the 
high score!”_

[Tiago Ling][tw8] has created the repo [Jitter Demo][l19] which demonstrates across
different frameworks jittering. The problem is it only appears in the CPP and Neko
targets with no solution so far. If you have an idea on how to solve it head over
to the repo's [issues][l20] to file the solution.

The [Ipsilon Developments][tw9] team have created an OpenFL extension implementing
Unity Ads released under the MIT license available on [haxelib][l21] and 
[GitHub][l22].

Origami Crush built with OpenFL has Android builds available 
through their Google+ [community][l23] which you have to request access too.

And to finish off this weeks roundup, [Gildas Paubert][tw10] has released the beta
of [AbstractPixel Run][l24]  _“a simple yet addictive arcade game. It follows 
the tradition of classic platformers and arcade gaming, but hybridize it with 
abstract generative landscapes and crazy electronic music.”_

![abstractpixel run](/img/311/abstractpixel.mp4)

Gildas says it was built with OpenFL and HaxePunk with a homemade HaxePunk 
[port][l25] of the Processing vector drawing API. You can currently download builds
for Windows and OSX with Android, iOS and Linux coming soon.

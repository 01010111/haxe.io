This years Haxe conference site has finally gone [live][l1]! Checkout the hard work
[Silex Labs][tw1] team have put into the site. They also have support from the Mozilla 
Foundation who will be [hosting][l2] this years conference in Paris.

[Sven Bergström][tw2] has written his second [article][l3] in his introducing Haxe 
series, titled Haxe Entry Point. Its one of those grap a coffee articles because it 
covers everything some one new to Haxe needs to know about haxelib, hxml files and
interacting with third party libraries with example code throughout the entire
article.

[Adam Le Doux][tw3] has written over on the snõwkit site the [article][l4]
Möbius Runner in which he recently made a game for a game jam which is a 
möbius-strip version of an infinite runner game created with luxe engine.

[Jip Spinnewijn][gh1] has [written][l5] about Making your OpenFL game Android TV ready.
Jip takes you through the process of adding the required info to your `project.xml`
file to get your OpenFL game working. He also takes you through the process he used
to created the extension [Android Mode Type][l6] which tells you if your game is 
running on Android TV or not.

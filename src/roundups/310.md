# Haxe Roundup № 310

![wwx 2015](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

This years Haxe conference site has finally gone [live][l1]! Checkout the hard work
[Silex Labs][tw1] team have put into the site. They also have support from the Mozilla 
Foundation who will be [hosting][l2] this years conference in Paris. There is also
a crowdfunding campaign which will launch this Monday 9th March.

[Sven Bergström][tw2] has written his second [article][l3] in his introducing Haxe 
series, titled Haxe Entry Point. Its one of those grab a coffee articles because it 
covers everything someone new to Haxe needs to know about haxelib, hxml files and
interacting with third party libraries with example code throughout the entire
article.

[Adam Le Doux][tw3] has written over on the snõwkit site the [article][l4]
Möbius Runner in which he recently made a game for a game jam which is a 
möbius-strip version of an infinite runner game created with luxe engine.

[Jip Spinnewijn][gh1] has [written][l5] about Making your OpenFL game Android TV ready.
Jip takes you through the process of adding the required info to your `project.xml`
file to get your OpenFL game working. He also takes you through the process he used
to created the extension [Android Mode Type][l6] which tells you if your game is 
running on Android TV or not.

[Andreas Rønning][tw7] has created [NormCubeGen][l17], a tool which generates
normalized cubemaps, _I think_, using Neko or HxCPP.

[Mo Omer][tw4] has released Appcelerator Titanium Mobile [externs][l7] created using 
[BuildHX][l8] allowing you to target iOS, Android, Windows, BlackBerry and the web
by compiling to JavaScript.

[Tom Vian][tw5] has released [ChipTone][l9] a free sound effects and music tool
[created][l10] with OpenFL, compiled to Flash.

The open source UI library [Feathers][l14] has an unofficial OpenFL [port][l15] 
which is based on Feathers `2.0`. Its still an in-progress port with a list
of current [limitations][l16].

And while I'm talking about about OpenFL, it has a new release, version `2.2.8`. 
Also Lime has a new release, version `2.1.3`. Check out [OpenFL's][l11] and [Lime's][l12]
changelogs for the gory details.

Lets finish another short roundup off with a trailer of Dead Alliance created with
HaxeFlixel by [Rakib Solewalker][tw6] which is _“a side scrolling action 
platforming shooter set in a zombie infected post apocalyptic world”_ available for
[iOS][l13].

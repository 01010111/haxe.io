# Haxe Roundup № 359

Welcome to the latest edition of the Haxe Roundup. [Haxe](http://haxe.org/?utm_source=haxe.io) is a high level, strictly typed programming language and cross-compiler.

Apologies for the month long delay, I've had a _series of unfortunate events_ these last few weeks, but a lot of amazing content has been released!

## News from the Community

### News and Articles

The [World Wide Haxe Conference 2016 crowd-funding](https://en.ulule.com/wwx2016/) campaign has met its first goal! The campaign currently stands at `106%` funded! You can [read more](https://www.ulule.com/wwx2016/news/goal-achievment-and-reevaluation-100128/) about the goal achievement and the goal re-evaluations. For those who
might still be debating to support the campaign Josefiene Pertosa has written
[Heading Towards WWX2016](http://haxe.org/blog/heading-towards-wwx-2016) which might persuade you.

There have been some great additions to the core compiler this last month,
the [Lua target](https://twitter.com/skial/status/716580549549273088) has been officially merged into the core, which was created by [Justin Donaldson](https://twitter.com/omgjjd), [Oleg](https://twitter.com/PeyTyPeyTy) and [Simon Krajewski](https://github.com/Simn), with Justin taking the responsibility of maintaining it.

[Mark Knol](https://twitter.com/mknol) has been working on an immensely awesome project for the community and the 
Haxe Foundation, [`code.haxe.org`](http://haxe.org/blog/the-haxe-code-cookbook, the _Haxe Code Cookbook_. The site is _powered by pull requests so it is easy to add **new content**. Everyone with a GitHub account can **contribute** by putting markdown formatted files_.
	
With the WWX2016 fundraising campaign almost over, [Clément Charmet](https://twitter.com/clemenchar) a few weeks ago asked if I would write some 
speaker interviews, like I did for WWX2014. You can find the initial [draft of questions](https://github.com/silexlabs/wwx2016/issues/29) I've written up, do you have any specific questions for any of this years [speakers](http://wwx.silexlabs.org/2016/)? Let me know if you.

[Jeff Ward](https://twitter.com/Jeff__Ward) has published a _slick_ macro
that allows you to have _properly typed [compile time constants](https://gist.github.com/jcward/4669dd9f1e79948d6a5e)_.

Jeff has also [written](http://jcward.com/Less+Glue+via+Haxe+Macro+Lazy+Props) about a more complex macro which eliminates the need 
for all the _glue logic_ you would write manually, with his [`lazy-props`](https://github.com/jcward/lazy-props) library. Jeff's `lazy-props` library is a great example of a concise, focused macro library.

[Justo Delgado](https://twitter.com/jdbaudi) has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/jdbaudi/status/715336534623436801) about a Haxe macro that he has [written](https://gist.github.com/mrcdk/c2579e2031baec4a218bab06bb7e4c87) which automatically generates incremented values for your
`@:enum abstract Something(Int) { ... }`.

[Marcelo de Moraes Serpa](https://github.com/fullofcaffeine) has published
on GitHub a [Angular 1 & Haxe 3](https://github.com/fullofcaffeine/hx_angular_helloword) sample using
the [angular.haxe](https://github.com/frabbit/angular.haxe) type definitions to demonstrate Haxe targeting JavaScript at a WDT talk in Mexico, that Marcelo gave.

There is a brand new Haxe **~~e~~book** out, titled [Discover HaxeFlixel](http://discover-haxeflixel.com/) written by [Leonardo Cavaletti](https://twitter.com/leongotgame), in which you'll _learn how to use the open-source HaxeFlixel framework to effortlessly develop and distribute your game on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, IOS and the web_.

Some of the latest videos from the last month.

## Updates from the Haxe core

335 commits have been made to Haxe compiler in the [last month].

- [Add the Lua target to Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5020).
- [Remove old `hxast` code](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/commit/52fa932adae06421378e2d32aaf693acfb97f9d1). Enable `cppast` by default, using the **brand new** HXCPP OCaml generator.
- [Initial support for `EntryPoint.hx` and `MainLoop.hx`](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5017) have been submitted, leading the way to a standard cross-platform async API, that all frameworks can overwrite or hook into. You can read the [original discussion](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues/3075) on potential issues, API design and more over on GitHub.
- [Add `Context.onAfterTyping`](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/commit/6deb765490e90e3f00c88efc6856342105c6034f), a macro callback _which is invoked after the compiler is done typing, but before optimization. The callback receives the types which have been typed. **It is possible to define new types in the callback**, in which case it will be called again with the new types as argument_.
- [Add `@:phpGlobal` and `@:phpConstant`](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5071), enabling better support for future PHP extern type definitions.
- [Improve handling of `Transfer-encoding: chunked`](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5021).
- [Java `v6` support added](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues/4220#issuecomment-204995192), behind the flag `-D java6`.
- [Auto detect rethrows](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5001) pull request.
- [Add `CppGoto`, use it for `break-in-switch-in-loop`](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5079) pull request.

You can start using the latest features by grabbing a [nightly build] of Haxe.

Have a good week everyone!

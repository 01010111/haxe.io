## Updates from the Haxe core

335 commits have been made to Haxe compiler in the [last month].

- [Add the Lua target to Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5020).
- [Remove old `hxast` code](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/commit/52fa932adae06421378e2d32aaf693acfb97f9d1). Enable `cppast` by default, using the **brand new** HXCPP OCaml generator.
- [Initial support for `EntryPoint.hx` and `MainLoop.hx`](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5017) have been submitted, leading the way to a standard cross-platform async API, that all frameworks can overwrite or hook into. You can read the [original discussion](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues/3075) on potential issues, API design and more over on GitHub.
- [Add `Context.onAfterTyping`](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/commit/6deb765490e90e3f00c88efc6856342105c6034f), a macro callback _which is invoked after the compiler is done typing, but before optimization. The callback receives the types which have been typed. **It is possible to define new types in the callback**, in which case it will be called again with the new types as argument_.
- [Add `@:phpGlobal` and `@:phpConstant`](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5071), enabling better support for future PHP extern type definitions.
- [Improve handling of `Transfer-encoding: chunked`](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5021).
- [Java `v6` support added](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues/4220#issuecomment-204995192), behind the flag `-D java6`.
- [Auto detect rethrows](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5001) pull request.

You can start using the latest features by grabbing a [nightly build] of Haxe.

Have a good week everyone!

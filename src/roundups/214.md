If you are participating in Ludum Dare 30 this weekend, remember to add your game to the
Ludum Dare 30 Haxe Roundup [todo][l10] when you have finished. To get your
gamedev juices flowing take a look at the [LD29 Haxe Roundup][l12].

A new library you can use in LD30 this weekend, created by [Andreas Rønning][tw2], is
[Delta][l11], a game focused tweening library for Haxe with a primary focus to have
better control of timing.

[Geoff Gaudreault][tw1] has released [Sploder Arcade Creator][l3] a game creator 
built using Haxe and OpenFL, which has been released to the [App Store][l4],
[Google Play Store][l5] and [Amazon][l6].

[Sean O'Dowd][tw3] has written [Building the first NHW game][l13] in which 
Manningham Neighbourhood Watch worked with Sean to create their first [game][l14], 
aimed at kids of all ages, which also needed to work across platforms, Sean decided 
to use the technology Nickelodeon and many others already use, Haxe and Flambe.

[Clément Charmet][gh2], author of the Haxe Sublime Text bundle has added better
`.hxml` scanning with new settings for advanced hxml [selection][l15].

![hordes zero](/img/214/hordeszero.png "Hordes Zero made with Haxe and OpenFL by @motiontwin_en")

[Jip Spinnewijn][tw4] has written about [finishing his first game][l16] which was
made with Haxe, OpenFL and HaxeFlixel. You can [play][l17] the game online or get 
it from the [Google Play Store][l18] or checkout the [source][l19] available from
GitHub.

A new feature available from the Haxe [nightly][l20] builds and hopefully the next
release of Haxe is `haxe.Rest<T>` which allows methods to accept an arbitrary number
of arguments of the given type.

[Lars Doucet][tw5] has released a [demo][l21] of a transition system he has been 
working on for HaxeFlixel.

I'm not sure who created and maintains it, but [Haxe Games Wiki][l22] is building
a resource on anything Haxe games related.

And to finish up, [Justin][g+1] continues to improve on his [Letters][l23] project.
You can get hold of the [source][l24] code which is available on GitHub or check 
out the canvas [demo][l25].

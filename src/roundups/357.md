## News from the Community

### News and Articles

The [World Wide Haxe Conference 2016 crowd-funding](https://fr.ulule.com/wwx2016/) campaign has officially [launched](https://twitter.com/silexlabs/status/707197540819714048)! The campaign currently sits at `3%` funded!

Its a _little late_, but the Haxe Foundation have _officially_ announced the
release of HaxeDevelop on their brand spanking new [blog](http://haxe.org/blog/meet-haxedevelop)!

Another recent post thats been released over on the HF blog, [`import.hx` Intro](http://haxe.org/blog/importhx-intro) by [Dan Korostelev](https://twitter.com/nadako), introduces you to a brand new
_sugar_ feature that's coming in the next release of Haxe.

While we are talking about the HF, [Mark Knol's](https://twitter.com/mknol)
work to improve and unify the HF design across the various sites has started 
to appear live, with the first being on [try.haxe.org](http://try.haxe.org/).

about the current [state of gamedev in Haxe](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/48z54l/the_state_of_gamedev_in_haxe/) which has been well received. Well done on promoting Haxe so well!

# Haxe Roundup № 195

[Lars Doucet][tw 1] has released some impressive news on the upcoming Defender's Quest 2
game. [Nobua Uematsu][w 1], the world famous video game composer, [will be working on the main
theme][a 1].

[Tom Gattenhof][tw 2] has written the article [An experiment with HTML5 in HaxeFlixel][a 2]
while looking for a cross-platform solution that can export to HTML5, Android and iOS.

In contrast to Tom's positive start with the Haxe ecosystem, [Talha Kaya][tw 3] writes
about his [bumpy start][a 3] with OpenFL and Haxe, the out of date tutorials, and some
naive assumptions. 

Talha's article is a great as it focuses on the problems people are facing when 
investigating the Haxe ecosystem and the lackluster impression that, sometimes,
can be left behind.

A quote from Talha's article that sums Haxe up and made me smile was _“this particular page that I
was looking at was from July 2013_. _Thats like a hundred years ago in Haxe history”_.

[Chase Pettit][tw 4] has written his game [Rival Bombs][d 1], a bomberman clone, created with 
HaxeFlixel and all his development progress documented on [Giant Bomb's forums][l 1].

Reach3dx the cross-platform game engine in development by GameBase have been interviewed
by Gaming Bolt on [bringing console level gaming to smartphones and tablets][a 4]. _“The combination
of OpenFL and Haxe was something that just made complete sense from a performance and user experience
perspective”_.

The upcoming, kind of stealth Haxe WebGL engine, Haxor, now has an [twitter][tw 5] and [g+][g 1] accounts.

[Jarkko Syrjälä][tw 6] has [ported][gh 1] the super fast AS3 implementation of the rectangle packer algorithm to Haxe.

[Clément Charmet][tw 7] has a [Mongoose][l 2] class which can now create strictly typed models 
in Haxe/Node.js via some Haxe [macro magic][l 3]. And when I say mongoose, I mean [MongooseJS](http://mongoosejs.com/)
, the mongodb object modeling library.

[Julien Samama][tw 8] has updated his [Dungeon Builder][gh 2] with a new algorithm which
creates things like this [awesome picture][l 4].

[Enet] native bindings have been created for Haxe. For those not familiar with Enet,
its a _“thin, simple and robust network layer on top of UDP”_. Realtime multiplayer
OpenFL games anyone?

The [HyperFiction] team have released [HypSystem] native extension for OpenFL iOS and
Android targets. It provides network, device information and some additional Android
specific information.

And the [Knowledge Players] team have created the [KalturHaxe] library which provides
a wrapper around the [Kaltura API].

[Thomas][tw 11] has written an [overview] of his concerns on OpenFL and the ecosystem
being fragmented, difficult to contribute to, breaking on each release but also how
promising and impressive Haxe and OpenFL are. Thomas's concerns surfaced from this
[discussion] on twitter.

[Joshua Granick][tw 12] has responded to those concerns in his article [Increasing Alignment][a 5]
in which he explains the decisions that him to fork NME and HXCPP. He also goes on to talk about his
future plans for Haxe, Lime, NME and OpenFL.

And to finish up, another new twitter account for Haxe has appeared, [Github Haxe][tw 9] is a news feed
of Haxe Github repos being talked about on twitter. Its created and maintained by [Ben Johnson][tw 10].

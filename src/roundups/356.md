# Haxe Roundup № 356

Welcome to the latest edition of the Haxe Roundup. [Haxe](http://haxe.org/?utm_source=haxe.io) is a high level, strictly typed programming language and cross-compiler.

## News from the Community

### News and Articles

Lets start off with something thats been in the pipe lines for a long time
now, `haxe.org` has _finally_ gotten its own [blog](http://haxe.org/blog)!
The content I've luckily been privvy too in the past that might make its way
onto the blog is just brilliant.

[Wighawag](https://twitter.com/wighawag) has created a very interesting
project called [gcusage](http://lib.haxe.org/p/gcusage/), which allows you to get _“gc usage [information] for some portion of your code to test for allocations”_, utilising macro magic. This is _only_ for the HXCPP target. Its
been [hinted](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/haxelang/gcusage/haxelang/hlaIKD1Pbs8/mPOFPSqNEQAJ) that gcusage could be used by the Haxe compiler team
to detect performance regressions in their tests.

Wighawag used gcusage to create a [runtime for spriter](http://lib.haxe.org/p/spriter) that has zero allocations while 
animating for the HXCPP target.

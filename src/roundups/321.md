# Haxe Roundup № 321

The Haxe World Wide Conference is almost upon us, which starts this Friday 29th May.
I've kept quite about so much news I've come across which will come to light in the
next few days, but if your itching for teasers, head over to [Lars Doucet's][tw1]
Twitter page for console teasers.

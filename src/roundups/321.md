# Haxe Roundup № 321

The Haxe World Wide Conference is almost upon us, which starts this Friday 29th May.
I've kept quite about so much news I've stumbled across which will come to light in 
the next few days, its been difficult to keep quiet.

But if your itching for some WWX2015 teasers, jump over to [Lars Doucet's][tw1]
Twitter page for some OpenFL + HaxeFlixel WiiU teasers. You can also find the entire 
WWX2015 schedule online hosted by [Silex Labs][l1].

[Nikolay Grebenshikov][tw2] whos speaking at WWX2015 with his talk _“Jive: the
renovation of Aswing”_ has updated the [Jive UI][l2] and its [demo][l3] site with
new controls, _for example_, accordions, tables, dialogs and sliders.

[Juraj Kirchheim][tw3], _the macro master_ and WWX2015 speaker has released 
onto HaxeLib [tink_lang][l4], [tink_priority][l5] and [tink_syntaxhub][l6], most likely
preparing the way for his talks.

[Fiery Squirrel][tw7] has posted the [article][l16] Game Events, which is a roundup
of the events Henry Fernández attended while working on and promoting his game
Fluff Eaters created with OpenFL.

Another game created with OpenFL by [Vicen Fleitas][tw8] and available from the
[Play Store][l17] is Winged Mind.

The Fluid and Particles demo by [George Corney][tw9], originally written in OpenFL
has been [featured][l19] on Chrome Experiments, another huge boost of publicity!

The HaxeFlixel team have published an [article][l7] which explains the reasoning
for them launching a [Patreon][l8] page, also explaining where and how the donations will
be split.

[Ohmnivore][gh1] has released Monsieur Moustache, _an endless jumper_, created with
HaxeFlixel onto the [Play Store][l9], [itch.io][l10] **and** open sourced the game
onto [GitHub][l11].

[Jonathan][tw4] has released Space Spuds onto [itch.io][l12] available for free or
you can pay what you want. He has also added the source code to the download _if_
you pay `$5.00` or more so you can learn from a complete HaxeFlixel game.

[Leong Wai Yin][tw5] has released two more HaxeFlixel tutorials, [Image Trail / Blur
Effect][l13] and [Particles and Emitters][l14]. If you have been following the roundups
for awhile now, you will know that I think **highly** of these tutorials, they are 
easy going, clear and concise.

One of [Lars Doucet's][tw1] contributions, _potentially WWX2015 related_, has been 
to [commit][l15] a complete refactor of the gamepad API to HaxeFlixel on GitHub.

[Lubos Lenco][tw6] has released a Tower Balance [demo][l15] created with Kha, Blender,
HaxeBullet and ZBlend, which binds Kha and Blender together.

[SlavaRa][gh2] has released a FlashDevelop plugin which add support for postfix
code completion onto [GitHub][l18]. SlavaRa is looking for feedback, so send him 
any bugs you come across!

[Mike Almond][tw10] has ported [Keith Peters][gh3] tones library to Haxe, also
called [tones][l20]. Take a stab at the [demo][l21] site. The tones library will
allow you _“to quickly make sounds with the webaudio APIs”_ with some added extras.

[Francesco Agati][tw11] has released to HaxeLib [Riot.hx][l22] which wraps 
[Riot.js][l25]. Francesco has a complete [example][l23] on the Riot.hx GitHub
page, which is also compiled to a working [demo][l24].

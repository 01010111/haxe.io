# Haxe Roundup № 321

The Haxe World Wide Conference is almost upon us, which starts this Friday 29th May.
I've kept quite about so much news I've stumbled across which will come to light in 
the next few days, its been difficult to keep quiet.

But if your itching for some WWX2015 teasers, jump over to [Lars Doucet's][tw1]
Twitter page for some OpenFL + HaxeFlixel WiiU teasers. You can also find the entire 
WWX2015 schedule online hosted by [Silex Labs][l1].

[Nikolay Grebenshikov][tw2] whos speaking at WWX2015 with his talk _“Jive: the
renovation of Aswing”_ has updated the [Jive UI][l2] and its [demo][l3] site with
new controls, _for example_, accordions, tables, dialogs and sliders.

[Juraj Kirchheim][tw3], _the macro master_ and WWX2015 speaker has released 
onto HaxeLib [tink_lang][l4], [tink_priority][l5] and [tink_syntaxhub][l6], most likely
preparing the way for his talks.

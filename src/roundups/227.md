# Haxe Roundup № 227

[Lubos Lenco][tw1] has published two demos this week, a custom water [mesh shader][l1]
and a interactive [chesh][l2] board, both created with Lubos's own unreleased game
framework which integrates Blender and [Kha]. Even though these demos run on WebGL, 
because of Kha, Lubos can compile the demos for Windows, OSX, Linux, Android, iOS, Xbox,
and PlayStation Vita which are _just some_ of the compile platforms.

Another framework thats not quite released yet is [heaps] by [Nicolas Cannasse][tw2]. 
[David Elahee][tw3] posted the image below of real time animated vikings which
shows Heaps HTML and CSS Renderer. From what I understand, Heaps can compile to
Flash, JavaScript and any platform supported by [NME] and OpenFL.

![haxe heaps](/img/227/heaps.png "Heaps 3D HTML/CSS Renderer")

This time next week [Ludum Dare 31] will be in full swing, so you have the option of
using Kha, Lime, NME or snow which are all low level libraries but ready to use. Or
you have the option of using OpenFL, HaxeFlixel, HaxePunk, luxe engine, Heaps, Stencyl or
one of the other, many Haxe game frameworks, each of which build upon the
low level libraries.

What ever you decide to choose, make sure to put your game on the Ludum Dare 31 [Haxe
Roundup 31][l3] todo list. For _research_ purposes check out the [LD29] and [LD30]
roundups, they are pretty awesome.

[Darek Greenly][tw4] has ported a tool you can use in LD31, the [Pixel Sprite 
Generator][l4] which generates sprites _“by using a two dimensional mask [then]
the values in the mask are randomized and mirrored”_. Darek has also 
published it to [haxelib][l5].

If you're considering to use LD31 to evaluate Haxe and want to read up on some
of the game frameworks, head over to [haxecoder.com].

[Kirill Poletaev][tw5] who writes all of the tutorials on `haxecoder.com` has 
covered [OpenFL][l6], [HaxeFlixel][l7], [HaxePunk][l8] and has just started
writing tutorials for [luxe engine][l9].

If you're looking for articles explaining the language features, [Adi Reddy Mora][tw6]
has been writing well focused articles, with the latest on [Static Extensions][l10].

[Andrew Lion][tw7], just like Adi, has been writing about language features. His
latest article talks about [Enums][l11], from defining Enums to using reflection
on them.

And if you prefer to learn by digging through peoples code, [Eiyeron Fulmincendii][tw8]
has [updated][l12] his game [SQUARE] a _“reflex/endurance game where white 
obstacles have to be avoided and orange bonus yields you points”_, with the
[source] on GitHub.

[Thomas Baudon's][tw9] unplanned green lazer is now a feature!
![green](/img/227/green.mp4)

[Allan Dowdeswell][tw10] has started [A Haxe dev walks into a bar...][l16] joke
thread on Twitter. The [Haxe Hulk][tw11] is not impressed.

[Jeff Ward][tw13] has [posted][l15] some shots of hxscout alongside Adobe Scout
_“successfully interpreting some AS3 stack profiler data”_. This is a must watch 
project.

[TiagoLr][tw14] has launched [haxedomain.com], a website to show case _“Haxe based
utilities and applications”_. The first application to feature on `haxedomain.com`
is [Haxe Console]. Haxe Console is an online REPL, _read-eval-print loop_. Another 
project you have to watch.

[Frederico Bricker][tw12] has created the OpenFL AdMob [extension][l13]. The 
extension is available for iOS and Android targets and is available from
[haxelib][l14].

I will finish this roundup off with the latest video from [Boyan Ololoevich][tw15] in
which he shows you how to extend `HXML` completion with libraries from `haxelib` in
IntelliJ IDEA.

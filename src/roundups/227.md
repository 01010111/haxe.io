# Haxe Roundup № 227

[Lubos Lenco][tw1] has published two demos this week, a custom water [mesh shader][l1]
and a interactive [chesh][l2] board, both created with Lubos's own unreleased game
framework which integrates Blender and [Kha]. Even though these demos run on WebGL, 
because of Kha, Lubos can compile the demos for Windows, OSX, Linux, Android, iOS, Xbox,
PlayStation Vita which are _just some_ of the compile platforms.

Another framework thats not quite released yet is [heaps] by [Nicolas Cannasse][tw2]. 
[David Elahee][tw3] posted the image below of real time animated vikings which
shows Heaps HTML and CSS Renderer. From what I understand, Heaps can compile to
Flash, JavaScript and any platform target supported by [NME] and OpenFL.

This time next week [Ludum Dare 31] will be in full swing, so you have the option of
using Kha, Lime, NME or snow which are all low level libraries but ready to use. Or
you have the option of using OpenFL, HaxeFlixel, HaxePunk, luxe engine, Heaps, Stencyl or
one of the other, many Haxe game frameworks, each of which build upon the
low level libraries.

What ever you decide to choose, make sure to put your game on the Ludum Dare 31 [Haxe
Roundup 31][l3] todo list. For _research_ purposes check out the [LD29] and [LD30]
roundups, their pretty awesome.

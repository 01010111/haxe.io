# Haxe Roundup № 335

![haxeui v2 ian harrigan](/img/335/haxeuiv2.png "Preview of HaxeUI version 2.")

[Ian Harrigan][tw1] starts this weeks roundup off with [working demos of HaxeUI][l1]
`v2` demonstrating the OpenFL, Flambe, Kha and PixiJS backends. The amount of work
involving in implementing _each_ backend must be inmense, very impressive!

I'm not to sure if Haxe was directly used for this, _but_, [TiVo have recently
pushed out an update][l2] that adds Apple AirPlay support to their devices which
means you can stream **to** the Apple TV.

# Haxe Roundup № 335

![haxeui v2 ian harrigan social](/img/335/haxeuiv2.png "Preview of HaxeUI version 2.")

[Ian Harrigan][tw1] starts this week's roundup off with [working demos of HaxeUI][l1]
`v2` demonstrating the OpenFL, Flambe, Kha and PixiJS backends. The amount of work
involving in implementing _each_ backend must be immense, very impressive!

I'm not to sure if Haxe was directly used for this, _but_, [TiVo have recently
pushed out an update][l2] that adds Apple AirPlay support to their devices which
means you can stream **to** the Apple TV.

[Lars Doucet][tw2] has been profiling Defenders Quest HD using [HxScout][l3]
and has been finding plenty room for improvement through the Haxe stack. These
[four][l4] [different][l5] [issues][l6] [prevent][l7] lots of String and Array 
allocations and also inline lambdas to avoid local variable promotion.

[Pete Shand][tw3] has published **three** articles this last week.

- [Load assets into OpenFL Away3D via runtime texture packer][l8]
- [Load assets into Haxe Startling via runtime texture packer][l9]
- Presenting the [Haxe Delay Library][l10]

But, if thats not enough to whet your appetite, [Mixer][tw5] has published **three**
youtube tutorials, all using HaxeFlixel.

- [How to make a Pong Game #7 - Getting fancy and finishing up!][l12]
- [How to make a Planet Defence Game #1 - Creating the planet][l13]
- [How to make a Planet Defence Game #2 - Player movement][l14]

If game development isn't your thing, [Matthijs Kamstra][tw4] has updated the 
Haxe Nodejs tutorial site with a [lesson on creating a Slackbot][l11].

There are three upcoming talks featuring Haxe in the next couple of months.

- [Haxe for JavaScript developers][l15] by [Andy Li][tw6] on October Thursday 15th 2015
- [The architecture of a web application written in Haxe][l16][fr] by [David Mouton][tw7] on October Friday 16th 2015
- [Cooking up awesome web games with Haxe and Flambe][l17] by [Jeremy McCurdy][tw8] between November 15th & 17th 2015

This is a few days old, but, [James McNess][tw9] is [looking for a Australian cross
platform developer][l18] to get in contact with him.

[Niall Weedon][tw10] has created a WIP Haxe repository on GitHub called
[hxdecorate][l19]. Niall is looking for suggestions on to implement and improve
the library which aims to _“merge macros and metadata capabilities together to 
emulate decorators”_.

And to finish this week's roundup off is [Franco Ponticelli's][tw10] recent 
addition of the `Decimal` type to [thx.core][l20]. The `Decimal` type is perfect
for managing monetary transactions, or just when you need no loss of precision.

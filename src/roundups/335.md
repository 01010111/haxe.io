# Haxe Roundup № 335

![haxeui v2 ian harrigan](/img/335/haxeuiv2.png "Preview of HaxeUI version 2.")

[Ian Harrigan][tw1] starts this weeks roundup off with [working demos of HaxeUI][l1]
`v2` demonstrating the OpenFL, Flambe, Kha and PixiJS backends. The amount of work
involving in implementing _each_ backend must be inmense, very impressive!

I'm not to sure if Haxe was directly used for this, _but_, [TiVo have recently
pushed out an update][l2] that adds Apple AirPlay support to their devices which
means you can stream **to** the Apple TV.

[Lars Doucet][tw2] has been profiling Defenders Quest HD using [HxScout][l3]
and has been finding plenty room for improvement through the Haxe stack. These
[four][l4] [different][l5] [issues][l6] [prevent][l7] lots of String and Array 
allocations and also inline lambdas to avoid local variable promotion.

[Pete Shand][tw3] has published **three** articles this last week.

- [Load assets into OpenFL Away3D via runtime texture packer][l8]
- [Load assets into Haxe Startling via runtime texture packer][l9]
- Presenting the [Haxe Delay Library][l10]

But, if thats not enough to whet your appetite, [Mixer][tw5] has published **three**
youtube tutorials, all using HaxeFlixel.

- [How to make a Pong Game #7 - Getting fancy and finishing up!][l12]
- [How to make a Planet Defence Game #1 - Creating the planet][l13]
- [How to make a Planet Defence Game #2 - Player movement][l14]

If game developement isn't your thing, [Matthijs Kamstra][tw4] has updated the 
Haxe Node.JS tutorial site with a [lession on creating a Slackbot][l11].

# Haxe Roundup № 327

![slickrock chat app nodejs express abe social](/img/327/slickrock.jpg "Slickrock.io - simple, embeddable chat rooms")

[Nico May][tw1] has been working with [Abe][l1], an API combining Haxe, NodeJS
and Express by [Franco Ponticelli][gh1] and [Michael Martin-Smucker][gh2], to create
over several weeks, [Slick Rock][l2], a simple, embeddable, _“no username, no password
and no room setup”_ chat app.

As [stated][l3] on Slickrock's frontpage, they want it to be free. Unfortuantly,
running _anything_ cost money, so consider supporting Nico by [donating][l4].

The _slick_ design was coded by [Lorenzo Maieru][tw2].

[Andy Li][tw3], now a official Haxe Foundation member, has finished his first
job which was to update the standard library's jQuery typed externs. Head over 
to the [new jQuery article][l5] that Andy has posted for more info.

I'm still _confused_ on why the jQuery externs are even _in_ the standard library,
the standard library doesn't depend on jQuery and Andy's [jQueryExtern][l6] library
has, _until now_, been the only complete typed externs to use _and_ recommend.

The following article by [Matt Tuttle][tw4] details everything you need to [know
about hxml][l6] files. No matter your experience with Haxe, you _might_ learn
something new.

Dan from [Proletariat Inc][tw5] has posted the article [HxInflate - New Open Source Haxe
Serialization Library][l7] which gives a quick overview of hxInflate, which provides
versioning, streams and a fast optimized data format, creating a more
reliable serialization library suitable for live games or SaaS.

[Luca Mezzalira][tw6] has released `haxewatchify`, an automatic build tool for [Haxe
and OpenFL][l8] projects. In his article, Luca gives a brief introduction to the
tool, which you can install via NPM. Checkout the repositories [README.md][l9]
for detailed documentation.

[Lars Doucet][tw7] last week brought to [everyones attention][l10] the work 
[Justo Delgado][tw8] has been doing. Justo has been adding [shader support][l11]
to OpenFL, with the GitHub thread containing some sneak preview screen shots.

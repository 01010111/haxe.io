# Haxe Roundup № 338

[Tong][tw1], aka _disktree_, released updated JavaScript type
definitions for Chrome [extensions][l1] and Chrome [apps][l2]. Both support
Chrome from version `35` up to `45`. Also Tong has ported [nekoboot.neko][l3]
to [pure Haxe][l4]. If you've _never_ heard of `nekoboot`, it takes your `.n`
bytecode and merges it with the Neko VM, creating a single executable ready
for distrubition.

[Hugh Sanderson][tw2], _HXCPP creator_, has released [HXCPP `3.2.171`][l5] onto
HaxeLib. Hugh has also written [How I Improved HXCPP's Speed 6x][l6], in which
Hugh brings a Windows demo, taking 35 seconds to run **down** to 5.6 seconds, 
using the latest features now in HXCPP.

[Lars Doucet][tw3] [pointed out][l8] this [pull request][l9] which
saves `33%` of memory overhead in byte arrays for the HXCPP target. To use this
now, you will need a nightly build of [Haxe][l7] and [HXCPP][l10].

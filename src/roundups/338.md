# Haxe Roundup № 338

[Tong][tw1], aka _disktree_, released updated JavaScript type
definitions for Chrome [extensions][l1] and Chrome [apps][l2]. Both support
Chrome from version `35` up to `45`. Also Tong has ported [nekoboot.neko][l3]
to [pure Haxe][l4]. If you've _never_ heard of `nekoboot`, it takes your `.n`
bytecode and merges it with the Neko VM, creating a single executable ready
for distrubition.

Oh, and he's working on a [colour fading screensaver][l11].

[Hugh Sanderson][tw2], _HXCPP creator_, has released [HXCPP `3.2.180`][l5] onto
HaxeLib. This release is the first time HXCPP natively [includes][l14]
HxScout telemetry! Checkout the [changelog][l23] since version `3.2.170` for all
the latest details.

Hugh has also written [How I Improved HXCPP's Speed 6x][l6], in which
Hugh brings a Windows demo, taking 35 seconds to run **down** to 5.6 seconds, 
using the latest features now in HXCPP.

[Lars Doucet][tw3] [pointed out][l8] this [pull request][l9] which
saves `33%` of memory overhead in byte arrays for the HXCPP target. To use this
now, you will need a nightly build of [Haxe][l7] and [HXCPP][l10].

[Aymeric Lamboley][tw4] has written about a subject that affects the entire Haxe
stack, native extensions, in his post [A call to the Haxe community][l12]. This
isnt the first time this subject has cropped up, **but**, it might be the first
time a lasting solution is [in the works][l13].

[Andrew Lion][tw7] has released [game analytics][l18], which wraps 
[GameAnalytics.com][l19] [API][l20] with two different built-in DB backends.

This week has seen another set of tutorials for Haxe and OpenFL based frameworks
released.

To start, [Ryan Schaefer][tw5] has written [Per Pixel Collision][l15] for OpenFL,
a well-written article describing per pixel collision. You can download the source
directly from Ryan's site, which comes with pre-built HTML5 and Neko demos.

[Mixer][tw6] has released **another** set of HaxeFlixel tutorials.

- [How to make a Planet Defence Game #7 - User interface, health and money!][l16-27]
- [How to make a Planet Defence Game #8 - Main Menu][l16-38]
- [How to make a Planet Defence Game #9 - Speed Powerup][l16-9]

[Luke][tw8] has published two videos, which are not tutorials, but more his 
progress on Open Fledit, an editor for Haxe and OpenFL.

- [Open Fledit - Creating a visual editor for OpenFL][l22-53]
- [Open Fledit - Moving Objects on the canvas][l22-4]

[Voec][tmlr1] has posted the
video [Getting started with HaxePunk - Setup Guide][l17-35] onto YouTube, hopefully
the first of many.

[Lars Doucet][tw3] has written a _**brilliant**_ article, [Doing an HD Remake the
Right Way][l21] which mentions HaxeFlixel throughout, particularly in the UI 
section.

[Mykhailov Alex][tw10] has used Haxe and OpenFL to create [Sheep Stealer][l28] in 
which you are _“a furious, evil and treacherous wolf! Steal as 
many sheep as you can. Steal them all!”_

[Accidental Rebel][tw9] has published [Pop, Puff and Away!][l24], created with
Haxe and [2DKit][l25], to the [App Store][l26] and [Play Store][l27].

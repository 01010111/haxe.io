# Haxe Roundup № 338

[Tong][tw1], aka _disktree_, released updated JavaScript type
definitions for Chrome [extensions][l1] and Chrome [apps][l2]. Both support
Chrome from version `35` up to `45`. Also Tong has ported [nekoboot.neko][l3]
to [pure Haxe][l4]. If you've _never_ heard of `nekoboot`, it takes your `.n`
bytecode and merges it with the Neko VM, creating a single executable ready
for distrubition.

## News from the Community

### News and Articles

This week we have had [Silex Labs][tw1] [announce][l1]
the dates for this years WWX2016 conference,
taking place at the beautiful Mozilla Paris
building on 27th May through to the 30th May. They have also
decided to work on [WWX2016 through GitHub][l2]
making the event [even more Libre][l3]!

[Slava Tretyak][tw4] has written a useful article
that should help you create an [OpenFL extension
in 10 steps][l8].

It might be _a little late_, but it's great to see
what people have made in the [snõwkit LD 34
recap][l9] published by [Sven Bergström][tw5].

Sven also posted this years first dev log,
[snõwkit dev log 10 (threes, westport)][l12],
quickly covering the THREES web port using luxe
engine and The Westport Independent release, the
first commercially released luxe engine game. Being a dev log, it also covers the latest
decisions affecting the snõwkit collective.

[Ian Harrigan][tw6] has posted [Cooking with
fire!][l10] in which he previews the native
backend for HaxeUI `v2` working on Windows, Linux
and OSX. As the most popular? framework to offer
cross-platform & cross-framework UI, native or
not, consider supporting Ian by becoming a
[Patron][l11].

NanoFL, the vector and animation editor, version `3.0.3` has been [released](http://nanofl.com/docs/history/)
created by [Yaroslav Sivakov](https://bitbucket.org/yar3333/).

If you follow [Matthijs Kamstra](https://twitter.com/MatthijsKamstra) on
Twitter, you will have seen previews of [Playrr](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/playrr), an open source audio playrr, has been released in beta. Matthijs wrote a [quick
post](https://github.com/skial/haxe.io/issues/239#issuecomment-176363470) on what libraries he
used and what problems he sorted out.

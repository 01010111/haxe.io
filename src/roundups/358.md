### *Some* library releases

I'm particularly interested in quite afew library releases from the past
week.

[Carlos Ballesteros Velasco](https://github.com/soywiz) has released two
libraries, [haxe-ws `0.0.4`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/haxe-ws) and
[haxe-crypto `0.0.3`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/haxe-crypto).

[Haxe-ws](http://lib.haxe.org/p/haxe-ws) provides WebSockets to **every**
compiler target supported by Haxe.

[Haxe-crypto](http://lib.haxe.org/p/haxe-crypto) is a port of [Hurlant crypto](http://crypto.hurlant.com/) to Haxe, bringing a pure implementation of the TLS `1.0` protocol, public and secret key encryption protocol and _so_ 
much more. But it turned out that Haxe already had a port [ASCrypt](https://github.com/Meychi/ASCrypt) available for the last _year_.

[Brendan Graetz](https://github.com/bguiz) has created [hxstructs](https://github.com/bguiz/hxstruct), a collection of general purpose data structures and algorithms written in Haxe. It will be interesting
to see how this library turns out.

If your writing externs for the Php target or just need native access, 
consider looking into [Yaroslav Sivakov's](https://bitbucket.org/yar3333/) [phpnatives](http://lib.haxe.org/p/phpnatives) library.

[Asciiascetic](https://github.com/asciiascetic) has started 
[Farcek](https://github.com/asciiascetic/farcek), a small parser combinator 
library inspired by Haskell's Parsec. Even though in the `README` it says 
_“the library prioritizes for ease of use over performance”_, it will be
interesting to see how the library turns out and compares to others. There is
an older, existing library, [Parsex](https://github.com/sledorze/Parsex/) to
consider.

- [json-rpc `1.2.1`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/json-rpc)
- [extern-js-glob `git`](https://github.com/ExternKit/extern-js-glob)
- [farcek `1.1.2`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/farcek)

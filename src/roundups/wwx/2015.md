## Kha

[Robert Konrad][tw1] talked about one of the more unknown frameworks in Haxe,
[Kha][l1]. Robert covered the history leading up to the creation of Kha, formerly
called Kje and being a Java framework.

A difference Robert pointed out about is that Kha generates target specific source code,
so generally resulting in a faster build time as its doesnt rely on cross compiling `ndll`
files, _I think I got that right_.

Like most Haxe frameworks, Kha also generates IDE project files for you, allowing
easy debugger intergration. But Kha comes with alot of other tools, [Krafix][l2] 
and [Kraffiti][l4] are just a couple.

[Krafix][l2] allows you to compile GLSL to HLSL, AGAL, Metal and Vulcan's SPIV-R 
and works with [Nicolas Cannasse's][tw2] [hxsl][l3] language, which of course is
all cross-platform.

[Kraffiti][l4] takes your image assets and convert them to the best performing
format for your target.

Robert also had to mentioned [ZBlend][l5], by [Lubos Lenco][tw3], with combines
the Kha framework and all its tools to integrate into Blender to offer a
complete game making package.

Robert finished off demonstrating two new additions to Kha, targeting Oculus Rift,
Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard and generating the source code and 
running [Mampf Monster][l6] through Unity3D, gaining Unity's 21 platforms
to target.

## Isomorphic Haxe - Ufront

Ufront has been marked as the official web framework for Haxe which was originally
created by [Franco Ponticelli][tw4] and [Andreas Söderlund][g+1], but now in its
current form [Jason O'Neil][tw5] leads its development.

And with Jason at the helm, it powers [Haxe.org][l7], the brand new [lib.haxe.org][l8],
_of course_ the [Ufront.net][l9] website and afew client projects Jason has worked on.

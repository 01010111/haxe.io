# WWX2015 Highlights

This post is a brief post on what _I_ think were the main highlights from this
years WWX2015, hosted at Mozilla Paris and organised by Silex Labs, _even 
though I missed half of the second day :/_.

## 10 Years of ~~haXe~~ Haxe

Its already been **ten** years of Haxe which I've been writing Haxe roundups for
the last **five**! Alot has happened since the [first][l10] haXe roundup. A quick
note that _half_ of the links in the first roundup don't work any more.

## TiVo's Activity Library

[Todd Kulik][tw6] from TiVo spoke about their [Activity][l11] library which _“designed
to enable a cross-platform mechanism for allowing multiple contexts of execution 
to co-exist within a single program”_.

Todd mentioned that this wasn't a library TiVo needs themselves, but sees the Haxe
community needing. I agree, having other libraries built _ontop_ of Activity would
simplify cross-platform concurrency.

There was even mention of Activity been merged into the standard library.

## Isomorphic Haxe - Ufront

Ufront has been marked as the official web framework for Haxe which was originally
created by [Franco Ponticelli][tw4] and [Andreas Söderlund][g+1], but now in its
current form [Jason O'Neil][tw5] leads its development.

And with Jason at the helm, it now powers [Haxe.org][l7], the brand new [lib.haxe.org][l8],
_of course_ the [Ufront.net][l9] website and afew client projects Jason has worked on, including
Jason's startup [Today We Learned][tw7].

## Cppia

Cppia, pronounced _sepia_, is a new HXCPP target by [Hugh Sanderson][tw7] which is
the entire HXCPP library compiled to a single executable allowing you to iterate 
faster by compiling to instruction assembly which is then interpreted by Cppia.

This means you can run HXCPP code _without_ a cpp compiler. You can also create your
own Cppia host, including other libraries like [AcadNME][l13] which is a NME Cppia
host. There's even an [Android][l14] version of AcadNME available from the Play Store.

Currently Cppia is comparable to Jit Neko in terms of speed, which are both slower
than JavaScript engines. But if I understand correctly, the execution speed of 
Cppia scripts hasn't been optimised, yet. But if speed is an issue then compile
you own Cppia host which natively contains the _slow_ piece of code from your
script.

## Kha

[Robert Konrad][tw1] talked about one of the more, _unfortunately_, unknown frameworks in Haxe,
[Kha][l1]. Robert covered the history leading up to the creation of Kha, formerly
called Kje and a Java framework.

Like most Haxe frameworks, Kha generates IDE project files for you allowing
easier debugger integration. But Kha comes with alot of other tools, [Krafix][l2] 
and [Kraffiti][l4] are just a couple.

[Krafix][l2] allows you to compile GLSL to HLSL, AGAL, Metal and Vulcan's SPIV-R 
which works with [Nicolas Cannasse's][tw2] [hxsl][l3] language, which of course is
cross-platform.

[Kraffiti][l4] takes your image assets and convert them to the best performing
format for your target.

Robert also had to mentioned [ZBlend][l5] by [Lubos Lenco][tw3], which combines
the Kha framework and all its tools integrating with Blender to offer a
complete game making package.

He also lightly touched on a new feature, powered by macros, that allows
you to create multiplayer games with minor changes to your code. Kha
at compile time will create a headless nodejs server which has the final say. _It can
also rewind game time!_

Robert finished off demonstrating two new additions to Kha, targeting Oculus Rift,
Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard and generating the source code and 
running [Mampf Monster][l6] through Unity3D, gaining Unity's 21 platforms
to target.

[Robert][tw1] has published a series of articles detailing the new features in Kha,
[Kha/make unity][l20], [Networked Multiplayer][l21] and an [article][l24] based on his
WWX talk.

## OpenFL on Consoles

[Lars Doucet][tw8] gave an energetic talk, which he has distilled into an [article][l15]
for easier consumption, speaking about the progress of getting Lime and OpenFL onto consoles.

With the help from Joshua Granick, James Grey, Justo Delgado, Lucas Pope, Puzzl and Lars
himself have teamed up with [WayForward][l16] who have 25 years worth of console 
knowledge into their wfEngine which gives them access to the WiiU, 3DS, Xbox One, Xbox
360, PS3, PS4 and the PS Vita.

Lars and the team have made the most progress getting Lime and OpenFL working on the WiiU
solely because they got the WiiU dev kit first.

Remember this _isnt_ just for games, think of Netflix for example. Lars is currently looking for anyone
interested in Haxe, Lime and OpenFL being on consoles to fill out this [form][l17] to help
him gauge interest.

## And a few more

Of course there was more than these five topics at WWX2015.

[Philippe Elsass][tw9] talked about the history of FlashDevelop and Haxe, as well as
releasing [FlashDevelop 5][l23]. There's now going to be a [HaxeDevelop][l18].

![wwx flashdevelop apple](/img/wwx/2015/flashdevelop1.jpg "“Flash this is your death!”")

[Elliott Stoneham][tw10] gave his talk of getting GoLang programs transpiled to Haxe, in
which he demonstrated transpiling a GoLang nudity detector to Haxe and compiling to JavaScript.

![wwx nudity golang transpile](/img/wwx/2015/golang.jpg "GoLang Nudity Detector")

[Khaled Garbaya][tw11] published the [article][l19] _Introducing Duell Tool - A better
build tool for Haxe_ which Sven Otto and Rui Campos spoke about. Khaled's article can
explain it better than I can.

![wwx duell tool gameduell build tool](/img/wwx/2015/gameduell.jpg "Rui Campos talking about duelltool")

And lastly, a talk I wished I hadn't missed, [Daniel Glazman][tw12] spoke about Quaxe, a pure Haxe
HTML5 / CSS parser and renderer with native-like UI through Qt bindings. But apparently he ended with
concerns about the Haxe Foundation, its roadmap is unknown, its finances are unknown and the foundation
itself relatively unknown. 

The Haxe Foundation seem to have taken note and have started a [Project
Management][l22] repository to discuss and coordinate the future.

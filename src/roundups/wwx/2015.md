# WWX2015 Highlights

This post is a brief post on what _I_ think where the main highlights from this
years WWX2015, hosted at Mozilla Paris and organised by Silex Labs, _even 
though I missed half of the second day :/_.

## 10 Years of ~~haXe~~ Haxe

Its already been **ten** years of Haxe which I've been writing Haxe roundups for
the last **five**! Alot has happened since the [first][l10] haXe roundup. A quick
note that _half_ of the links in the first roundup don't work any more.

## TiVo's Activity Library

[Todd Kulik][tw6] from TiVo spoke about their [Activity][l11] library which _“designed
to enable a cross-platform mechanism for allowing multiple contexts of execution 
to co-exist within a single program”_.

Todd mentioned that this wasnt a library TiVo needs themselves, but sees the Haxe
community needing. I agree, having other libraries built _ontop_ of Activity would
simpilify cross-platform concurrency.

There was even mention of Activity been merged into the standard library.

## Cppia

Cppia, pronounced _sepia_, is a new HXCPP target by [Hugh Sanderson][tw7] which is
the entire HXCPP library compiled to a single executable, allowing you to iterate 
faster by compiling to instruction assembly, which is then interpreted by Cppia.

This means you can run HXCPP code _without_ a cpp compiler. You can also create your
own Cppia host, including other libraries like [AcadNME][l13] which is a NME Cppia
host. There's even an [Android][l14] version of AcadNME available from the Play Store.

Currently Cppia is comparible to Jit Neko in terms of speed, which are both slower
than JavaScript engines. But if I understand correctly, the execution speed of 
Cppia scripts hasnt been optimised, yet. But if speed is an issue, then compile
you own Cppia host which natively contains the _slow_ peice of code from your
script.

## Kha

[Robert Konrad][tw1] talked about one of the more, _unfortuantly_ unknown frameworks in Haxe,
[Kha][l1]. Robert covered the history leading up to the creation of Kha, formerly
called Kje and being a Java framework.

A difference Robert pointed out is that Kha generates target specific source code,
so generally resulting in a faster build time as its doesnt rely on cross compiling `ndll`
files. _I think I got that right_.

Like most Haxe frameworks, Kha also generates IDE project files for you, allowing
easy debugger intergration. But Kha comes with alot of other tools, [Krafix][l2] 
and [Kraffiti][l4] are just a couple.

[Krafix][l2] allows you to compile GLSL to HLSL, AGAL, Metal and Vulcan's SPIV-R 
and works with [Nicolas Cannasse's][tw2] [hxsl][l3] language, which of course is
cross-platform.

[Kraffiti][l4] takes your image assets and convert them to the best performing
format for your target.

Robert also had to mentioned [ZBlend][l5], by [Lubos Lenco][tw3], with combines
the Kha framework and all its tools, to integrate with Blender to offer a
complete game making package.

Robert finished off demonstrating two new additions to Kha, targeting Oculus Rift,
Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard and generating the source code and 
running [Mampf Monster][l6] through Unity3D, gaining Unity's 21 platforms
to target.

## Isomorphic Haxe - Ufront

Ufront has been marked as the official web framework for Haxe which was originally
created by [Franco Ponticelli][tw4] and [Andreas Söderlund][g+1], but now in its
current form [Jason O'Neil][tw5] leads its development.

And with Jason at the helm, it now powers [Haxe.org][l7], the brand new [lib.haxe.org][l8],
_of course_ the [Ufront.net][l9] website and afew client projects Jason has worked on, like
Jason's startup [Today We Learned][tw7].

## OpenFL on Consoles

[Lars Doucet][tw8] gave an energetic talk, which he has distilled into an [article][l15]
for easier consumtion, spoke about the progress of getting Lime and OpenFL onto consoles.

With the help from Joshua Granick, James Grey, Justo Delgado, Lucas Pope, Puzzl and Lars
himself have teamed up with [WayForward][l16] who have put 25 years worth of console 
knowledge into their wfEngine which gives them access to the WiiU, 3DS, Xbox One, Xbox
360, PS3, PS4 and the PS Vita.

Lars and the team have made the most progress getting Lime and OpenFL working on the WiiU
solely because they got the WiiU dev kit first.

Remember this _isnt_ just for games, think of Netflix. Lars is currently looking for anyone
who is interested in Haxe, Lime and OpenFL being on consoles to fill out a [form][l17] to help
him gauge interest.

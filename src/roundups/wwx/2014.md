# The WWX 2014 Roundup

![wwx 2014 haxe groups attendees](/img/wwx/2014/group.png "Group photo of all the WWX 2014 Attendee's")

## Nicolas Cannasse Opening Talk - One Year of Haxe

[Nicolas][tw1] opened the conference by going over what has changed in the
[last year][l1], the various releases, new features, additional syntax and further 
speed improvements.

Next, he goes onto explaining the future plans for Haxe `3.2`. This includes
completing the `haxe.io.Bytes` API by adding additional accessors and using 
Typed Arrays on the JavaScript target to provide a huge speed
improvement. Simon Krajewski's [hxparse][l2] library might provide a hint of whats to
come as it includes its own [byte][l3] class which uses the best underlying object
on each platform to get the best speed available.

The next feature planned is full Unicode support by providing `haxe.Ucs2`,
`haxe.Utf8` and `haxe.Utf16` which can automatically convert between each
encoding, full cross-platform conformity and the best performance available
for the underlying platform.

A few other features are also planned, to improve macro support, additional improvements
to `Date` by adding UTC support, moving SPOD to `haxe.db` and continue to improve
the Python target.

Nicolas goes onto describing who makes up the Haxe Foundation and what they do. The
Haxe Foundation have sponsered a handleful of projects, from HIDE, WWX, UFront and
the new [Haxe][l4] website created by [Jason O'Neil][tw2] who's also handling UFront.

![wwx 2014 haxe new website](/img/wwx/2014/new-haxe-site.jpg "The New Haxe Website")

The new site uses UFront, but without a database, instead relying on Github for all its
content. Clicking the `contribute` link at the bottom of any page will take you to the
relavant Github page to encourge community contribution and make it easy to review
changes and additions.

## Thomas Fétiveau - Development workflow with Cocktail and NME

[Thomas][tw3] shares his knowledge of using [Cocktail][l5], a HTML and CSS rendering
engine by SilexLabs the hosts of WWX. He starts off with the developement workflow that
he uses, start off by targeting any browser and once everything is working compile
using Cocktail to Flash player to see if anything needs fixing. Then compile using 
Cocktail and NME to target mobile platforms.

He then goes onto show projects he has used Cocktail in, [EBuzzing][l6] Buzz player, [TF1][l7]
connect app targeting Adobe AIR which plays live streams, realtime comments, votes and 
interactions on Twitter and Facebook, TF1 X player which compiles to HTML5, Flash, native
iOS and Android and available as a native app fragment. With each project, Cocktail has
been improved with new features and bug fixes.

But it does have its limitations like any library. It currently doesnt have full CSS support,
missing something HTML elements. Its best to checkout Cocktails HTML and CSS [status][l8]. But
it is great for apps that need to target web and native with no compromise on performance and
compatibility.

## Hugh Sanderson - C++ Magic

[Hugh][tw4] introduces _“C++ Magic”_ which gives low-level libraries access to
platform specific functions.

![wwx 2014 haxe cpp magic](/img/wwx/2014/hugh-magic.jpg "Haxe C++ Magic")

The most basic level of manipulation is to add paths and libraries to your `build.xml`
file. Hugh classes this as nothing more than a conjuror of cheap tricks. You can
control the build tool through the use of enviroment variables, by using compiler 
defines or by toolchains which are usally part of a haxelib library.

Hugh goes onto to explain that `untyped` _“skips most type checking but still needs
valid syntax”_ to work. If you want to interface between Haxe and external code you
need to use `__global__` and `__cpp__` along with `untyped`.

`untyped __global__.MessageBox(0, "Hello", "Title", 0)` gives you access to global 
scope which is useful because Haxe doesnt have one. On the other hand 
`untyped __cpp__('printF("Hello")')` parses as a local function call. In both cases `"Hello"`
is autocast from a Haxe string to a native string.

Hugh has also introduced the `cpp.*` package which contains `NativeArray`, `String`,
`Float32`, and `UInt8` which are used as [static extensions][l20].

He then ramps up the magic to include metadata. He provides metadata for classes
and functions.

For classes you have the following:

* `@:headerClassCode(...)` which injects member variables and inline functions.
* `@:headerCode(...)` which includes external headers.
* `@:headerNamespaceCode(...)` which allows you to add to the global namespace.
* `@:cppFileCode(...)` which allows you to include external headers only in C++ files.
* `@:cppNamespaceCode(...)` which implements static variables.
* `@:buildXml(...)` which allows you to add to the `build.xml` file.

For function metadata you get the following:
	
* `@:functionCode(...)`
* `@:functionTailCode(...)`

Hugh stats these are largely redundant as you should use `untyped __cpp_(...)` 
instead.

The next section is on `extern` magic. As far as I'm aware the C++ target has never supported
extern classes like the other targets, until now. This is now possible because of 
all the new features introduced above. Here is an example from Hugh's slide.

```
//	Avoids generating dynamic accessors.
@:unreflective
//	Marks an extern class as using struct access(".") not pointer("->").
@:structAccess
@:include("string")
@:native("std::string")
extern class StdString {
	@:native("new std::string")
	public static function create(inString:String):cpp:Pointer<StdString>;
	public function size():Int;
	public function find(str:String):Int;
}

class Main {
	
	public static function main() {
		var std = StdString.create("my std::string");
		trace( std.value.size() );
		std.destroy();
	}
}
```

Before Hugh shows off his demo, he goes into his future plans he has for the C++ target,
this includes more native integration, a fully native Int64 implementation, a 
possible concurrent GC and fake classes and interfaces.

![wwx 2014 haxe cpp magic demo](/img/wwx/2014/cpp_demo.jpg "C++ Magic Demo")

If you want to run the demo yourself, download the binary either for [OSX][l21] or
[Windows][l22]. You will need a webcam for it to work. If you want to attempt to
build it yourself head over to Hugh's website for [instructions][l23].

## Bruno Garcia - Flambe Future

[Bruno][tw5] who is the JavaScript target maintainer, who also started
[Haxe Meme][l9] and wrote [Flambe][l10] a 2D game engine. Flambe has had amazing
growth and adoption with over 200 commerical games built with Flambe. Bruno has
a strong focus on developer UX, focused on tool intergration and rapid development.

Nickelodeon started evaluating HTML5 game engines in 2012 and today all new games
are built with Flambe which has helped it go viral across the industry. Disney and
Viacom, two of the top 4 media companies worldwide use Flambe. The top two toy
companies worldwide, Hasbro and Mattel use Flambe, as well as CocaCola, Toyota,
Spil Games and Mozilla.

![wwx 2014 haxe flambe](/img/wwx/2014/switching-to-dart.jpg "Haxe is too mainstream!?!")

Bruno puts the success on good HTML5 support with graceful enhancement, [Flump][l11]
which exports `fla` files to a GPU friendly format, its high performance, the native
extensions and a focus on developer UX, by decently documenting code and all new API's
__must__ be documented.

He goes onto demostrate a few code examples in AS3 verus Haxe & Flambe. The Haxe & Flambe
versions are considerbrly shorter and succilent compared to their AS3 versions. He plans
to implement features which users have been asking for, tilemap loading, polygon 
rendering and video playback. One of the more interesting areas for me would be a
new native app backend built with Lime.

## Jean-Baptiste Richardet - Whats your favorite Haxe IDE?

[Jean-Baptiste][tw6] talks about the various IDE's available to Haxe and how to
choose an IDE. He starts off with the most popular IDE, determined by a [twitter
survey][l12], Sublime Text for it being multi platform, powerful and light with
great autocompletion thanks to [Clément Charmet's][tw7] Haxe sublime bundle.

![wwx 2014 sublimetext ide](/img/wwx/2014/sublime.png "SublimeText Haxe Bundle")
![wwx 2014 flashdevelop ide](/img/wwx/2014/flashdevelop.png "FlashDevelop")
![wwx 2014 intellij idea](/img/wwx/2014/idea.png "IntelliJ IDEA")
![wwx 2014 hide](/img/wwx/2014/hide.png "HIDE")

The next most popular IDE for Haxe is FlashDevelop, with has incredibly smart code
completion, Flash and C++ debugging builtin, intergrated source control and is free
and open source. I expect it came second because its Windows only.

Third place goes to IntelliJ IDEA, a multi platform, powerful IDE with code refactoring,
analyzing, beautifying and more. The Haxe completion is a open source plugin which
works with the free community edition but the plugin is out of date so autocompletion
has taken a hit.

The forth position goes to the newest Haxe IDE HIDE which is multi platform, built
ontop of NodeJS, is free and open source and integrates with Haxelib. HIDE is under
active development so new features are being added all the time, its a promising IDE
for Haxe that the Haxe Foundation have sponsered.

There are other IDE's [available][l13], FDT, MonoDevelop, TextMate, Geany and Vim/Vaxe.

## Juraj Kircheim - Tinkerbell, Haxe on Wings

[Juraj][tw8], master of macros, starts off with with how Haxe has delivered on the
promise Java failed to keep. Juraj introduces Tinkerbell which is never going to be
one framework or finished, thats it is a continusous work in progress of many small
well documented packages.

Tinkerbell currently consists of `tink_core`, `tink_macro`, `tink_lang`, `tink_priority`,
`tinx_autospod` and `tink_template` with more to come.

With the philosophy behind all his libraries being composibility, Juraj introduces
Tinkerbell Language Extensions which add [short lambdas][l14], [extened loops][l15],
optmized loops with x1.5 to x4 times speed up for Flash and faster on over targets,
[partial implementations][l16], [syntactic forwarding][l17] and loads more additions
all by adding `implement tink.Lang` to your classes.

Juraj goes on to introduce [Tink Auto SPOD][l19] extension. This automatically connects to
your database, creates any missing tables and missing columns and initializes SPOD for
you.

Next he introduces [Tink Template][l18] with is largely compatible with 
`haxe.Template` but is a compile time template language with rich syntax, including
`switch`, `while`, `for`, `var` and `function`. Your templates are compiled into true
Haxe classes which can implement interfaces and extend classes.

## Justin Donaldson - Promhx

[Justin][tw9] introduces [Promhx][l24] a promise and functional reactive programming
library that aids in asynchronous programming by explaining what Promhx attempts to
fix. It breaks up computation into multple loops, removing the need to wait for
a server response, by providing a better way of handling errors in async code, by
making async code easier to read and providing a single solution for use on the
client and server side.

For the JavaScript target, Justin has made sure it avoids scheduling a repaint in the
browser by using `setImmediate` which runs after all operations such as events and 
display updates has finished. For the other platforms you have to provide your own
event loop. The Haxe Foundation are [thinking][l25] of providing a base abstract 
loop to help build crossplatform APIs.

Promhx is well [tested][l26] with 30+ tests which are run on 7 platforms with only
the CSharp and Php targets having issues. And compared to the various JavaScript
promise libraries in terms of speed Promhx is one of the fastest.

## Todd Kulick - Haxe as Web development platform for TiVo?

## Péter Sipos - Haxe as Web development platform for Prezi?

[Péter][gh1] 

## Elliott Stoneham - Haxe as a compilation target for other languages

[Elliott][tw10] takes a different approach to Haxe, instead of making Haxe target
another language, he is targeting Haxe.

Elliott is using Go to target Haxe, comparing Go to the [TARDIS][l27] _“a small
idiosyncratic exterior [which] conceals large scale quality engineering”_ and compares
Haxe to a [sonic screwdriver][l28] _“an easy to use tool built on engineering
excellence that is useful in a wide range of situations”_.

With the three authors of Go being responsible for Google's V8 JavaScript engine and 
UTF8 amoung many other achievments, Go's objectives are to be readable, safe and
efficeient, good concurreny and a tool which can operate at Google's scale.

With Go being 5 years old compared to Haxe's 9 years, having 13x more Github 
repositories, having 6x more Twitter followers, 17x more Google+ followers and being
on the [TIOBE][l29] index, Elliott proposes that Haxe should be used as a intermediate
language for TARDIS Go, his Go to Haxe transpiler.

By targeting Haxe you can get Go's concurrency, goroutines and channels which gets
transformed into [SSA][l30] representation which then generates Haxe code recreates
the same behaviour as the original Go code, then you do your usual Haxe compiling.

Elliott has two demos demostrating Go to Haxe compiling, with the [first][l31] showing
eight Gophers with each gopher being a `goroutine` and the pile of books being `channel`.
The [second][l32] example is an interactive demostration showing a goroutine reacting
to a channel of events generated by your mouse.

The compiler team have mentioned a [couple][l33] of [times][l34] of using SSA to bring
further optimisations to the Haxe compiler.

# Development Workflow with Cocktail and NME by Thomas Fétiveau

![youtube 100%x100%](-iKEMzPWpbo)

[Thomas][tw3] shares his knowledge of using [Cocktail][l5], a HTML and CSS rendering
engine by SilexLabs the hosts of WWX. He starts off with the development workflow that
he uses, starting off by targeting any browser and once everything is working, compile
using Cocktail to the Flash player to see if anything needs fixing. Then compile using 
Cocktail and NME to target mobile platforms.

He then goes onto show projects he has used Cocktail in, [EBuzzing][l6] Buzz player, [TF1][l7]
connect app which targets Adobe AIR, displaying live streams, real time comments, votes and 
interactions on Twitter and Facebook, the [TF1][l7] X player which compiles to HTML5, Flash, native
iOS and Android and available as a native app fragment. With each project, Cocktail has
been improved with new features and bug fixes.

But it does have its limitations like any library. It currently doesn't have full CSS support,
missing some HTML elements. Its best to checkout Cocktails HTML and CSS [status][l8] page. But
it is great for apps that need to target web and native with no compromise on performance and
compatibility.

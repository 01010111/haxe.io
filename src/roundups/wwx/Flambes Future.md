[Bruno][tw5] who is the JavaScript target maintainer, who started
[Haxe Meme][l9] and wrote [Flambe][l10], a 2D game engine starts off by stating how
Flambe has had amazing growth and adoption with over 200 commercial games built 
with Flambe. Bruno has a strong focus on developer UX, focused on tool integration
and rapid development.

Nickelodeon started evaluating HTML5 game engines in 2012 and today all new games
are built with Flambe which has helped it go viral across the industry. Disney and
Viacom, two of the top 4 media companies worldwide use Flambe. The top two toy
companies worldwide, Hasbro and Mattel use Flambe, as well as CocaCola, Toyota,
Spil Games and Mozilla.

Bruno puts the success on good HTML5 support with graceful enhancement, [Flump][l11]
which exports `fla` files to a GPU friendly format, its high performance, the native
extensions and a focus on developer UX, by decently documenting code and all new API's
__must__ be documented.

He goes onto demonstrate a few code examples in AS3 versus Haxe & Flambe. The Haxe & Flambe
versions are considerably shorter and succulent compared to their AS3 versions. He plans
to implement features which users have been asking for, tilemap loading, polygon 
rendering and video playback. One of the more interesting areas for me would be a
new native app backend built with Lime.

# Haxe Roundup № 224

![luxe westport](/img/224/luxe-westport.jpg "The Westport Independent at Comic Con Stockholm built with luxe engine")

[Sven Bergström][tw1] has published the first snõwkit community focus sheet,
named [alpha-1.0+parrott][l1]. I suggest that you first take the time to read up
on the concept of [focus sheets][l2], then continue reading `alpha-1.0+parrott`.

With the release of the first focus sheet, Sven is setting a solid, strong and
structured set of guidelines for the community to follow. Also by focusing on one
problem at a time, he is enabling the community to have time to have an indepth
discussion.

From last weeks [roundup][l3], which featured [Nico's][tw2] origami swan created with
luxe engine, Nico has released the source code for [luxe mesh][l4], the art project 
which allowed him to create the awesome image.

Nico is also working on something new...
![nico proto](/img/224/nico-proto.mp4)

[Philippe Elsass][tw3] has published two posts [Y U NO HAXE? Misconceptions!][l5]
which demystifies opinions of Haxe that have probably been hanging around since 2007
and [Vanilla Haxe JS][l6] which shows how easy Haxe makes writing plain, typesafe
transpiled JavaScript.

[Mark Knol][tw4] recently demoed smart autocompletion of `getElementsByTagName`, 
which uses macros to do all the hard work.

![smart macro](/img/224/smart-macro.mp4)

[Franco Ponticelli][tw5] continues to release new parts of his `thx` libraries, this
time [thx.format][l7] which _“adds formatting options on top of common Haxe types”_.
Definitely check it out as Franco always releases quality.

[Pony][l12] an open, cross-platform library by [AxG][tw10] has recently had
Touch and Starling support added by [mmaletin][gh1]. It looks like alot of useful
features are coming to Pony, the latest being FlashDevelop [templates][l13]. 

AxG has also recorded a [demo][l14] of installing the template and using Pony and 
Starling together.

[Kirill Poletaev][tw6] has changed directions these last couple of days by releasing
[tutorials][l8] on HaxeUI. Its great to see non-game related Haxe tutorials, as they
are desperately needed.

Another tutorials, this time from [Sven][tw1] titled [Haxe: Compile Time Macros][l9].
Sven provides a nice, gentle introduction to macros by showing you how to embed a 
MD5 encoded string into your output file as a static variable or inlined.

Below is another preview of Shifter, a game I've featured before 
by [Bomb-o-cracker][tw7] using HaxeFlixel.

![shifter](/img/224/shifter.mp4)

[Lars Doucet][tw8] recently wrote [DQ2 Update and DQ1HD Announcement][l10] which
confirms that the Defender's Quest 1 HD re-release will be using Haxe, OpenFL and
HaxeFlixel which also will be powering Defender's Quest 2.

While I'm kind of talking about OpenFL, [Fredrico Bricker][tw9] has created
an OpenFL [extension][l11] for Android and iOS which displays native WebViews.

I'll finish this weeks roundup off an in development game, Evoland 2!

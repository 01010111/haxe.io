# Haxe Roundup № 315

[Andy Li][tw1] has taken the lead in getting Haxe officially supported on 
[Travis CI][l1] with help from [Cauê Waneck][tw2] and [Simon Krajewski][gh1].
Testing your Haxe project has been greatly simplified now, checked out the
[guide][l2] to using Haxe on Travis CI. Remember, if you want full, cross-platform
testing consider [travis-hx][l3] which provides helpers to test you project on 
Travis CI, Appveyor and SauceLabs.

[Lars Doucet][tw3] has published [proof][l4] of OpenFL's port of BunnyMark demo 
running on the WiiU! This is in _“debug mode (ie slower than release) [with]
2000 bunnies at 25FPS @ 1080p on the WiiU”_.

A recently released game which can take advantage of the future OpenFL console support
is [Goumy Sticks][l5] by [Sebastien Carceles][g+1].

> Tikids applications allow your children to develop their competences and 
abilities the way they want. One application for one ability. Tikids 
gets inspiration with the free Montessori workshops.

You can download Goumy Sticks for [iOS][l6], [Android][l7] and from [Amazon][l8].
Sebastien is already working on his next game Goumy Sort which you can keep an eye
on over on [FaceBook][l9].

The OpenFL team have announced the release of [OpenFL Hybrid][l16].

> The biggest new feature is OpenFL "hybrid" mode. 
As you may already know, OpenFL 3 supports two different build modes, the 
default is a unified OpenFL, that is consistent across all target platforms, 
for Flash, for HTML5, for desktop, mobile or console native targets. The 
second build mode is called "legacy", which only works for native desktop 
or mobile. This is the older OpenFL renderer and platform backend, familiar 
to OpenFL 1 and OpenFL 2 behaviors.

[Juakob][gh2] has created and released [SpreadSheet-Haxe][l17] which, _I think_,
allows you to load data from Google Spreadsheets into your OpenFL app.

[Adi Reddy Mora's][tw4] continuous hard work on the Haxe [externs][l10] for 
Pixi.js have become an official part of the Pixi.js [organisation][l11]!

[Sven Bergström][tw5] continues his ~~hack and slash~~ refinement of the snõw
API which he talks about in the latest snõwkit [dev log][l12] issue 4. As usual its
a great read following the changes and decisions going on inside an in flux 
library.

[Darek Greenly][tw6] has posted his first [Gray Scale][l13] dev log over on the 
snõwkit community site about his game he made for the GameBoy Jam last year.

> It was made in HaxeFlixel but I wanted more control over my code and be 
able to easily create lots of enemies with different abilities. After few 
hours of googling I stopped by a thing called "Component Entity System" and 
finally found luxe engine (and so far I love it!)

The embedded GIFs look amazing.

Here is game trailer from [Hong-Chin][tw7] for Endless Fight made with HaxeFlixel.

[Fuz][tw8] is back with another completed [Haxe challenge][l14] which _“in this game 
you’ll have to move the ghosts on ice with a swipe gesture to place them in 
their correct area”_.

Player03 talks about automatic layout in his article [Not-so-simple SWF Layout][l15]
that you can use in your OpenFL projects.

And to finish this roundup off, [Slava Tretyak][tw9] has renamed `FastIteratingStringMap`
to `LinkedMap`, now [available][l18] for every Haxe target. If you're not familiar
with `FastIteratingStringMap` then checkout Slava's [blog][l19] where he has
benchmarked his class against the standard library `StringMap` implementation.

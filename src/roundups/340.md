# Haxe Roundup № 340

We will start off with, _probably_, the most important news from this week,
that Haxe `3.2.1` has been [released][l1] and is now available for [download][l2].
[Andy Li][tw1] has [tweeted][l3] the official, _alternative_ ways you can
install Haxe through the various package managers, homebrew and chocolatey, for 
example.

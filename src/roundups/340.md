# Haxe Roundup № 340

We will start off with, _probably_, the most important news from this week,
that Haxe `3.2.1` has been [released][l1] and is now available for [download][l2].
[Andy Li][tw1] has [tweeted][l3] the official, _alternative_ ways you can
install Haxe through some of the various package managers, homebrew and chocolatey, 
for example.

With the latest release of Haxe `3.2.1`, there have been a bunch of HaxeLib
updates and releases, here are a few:
	
- [PixiJS `3.0.25`][l4], a set of externs for pixi.js `v3`.
- [Haxpression `0.0.3`][l5], a basic math expression parser and evaluator.
- [Hxmeteor `0.2.0`][l6], which provides bindings and tools to use meteor.js with Haxe.
- [React `0.2.0`][l7], a set of externs and tools to use Facebook's React with Haxe.

Hxmeteor has been created and used by [Tiago Ribeiro][tw2] for [Haxe Resource][l8],
which _“is meant to aggregate documentation, tutorials and articles related to 
Haxe, its a community oriented site like a wiki but tailored for this specific 
case with its own features”_, which was [announced over on the mailing list][l9].

React is the newest [Massive Interactive][tw4] library to be released, created by 
[Philippe Elsass][tw3], which provides WIP _“externs and tool functions leveraging 
Haxe's excellent type system and compile time macros to offer a strongly typed 
language to work with the increasingly popular React library”_, which was
[announced on the mailing list][l10]. It also comes with its own [todo-app][l11].

Philippe also has released the [webpack Haxe repository][l12], which demonstrates
_“the creation of a Haxe JavaScript modular project leveraging Webpack for 
bundling (code and assets) and lazy loading”_. 

As Andy Li [puts it][l13], _“compiling Haxe code to JavaScript is better than using
TypeScript, ES6 and ES2015”_, which he proves in his [London JS online 
presentation][l14].

It's been confirmed that [Brendan Graetz][tw5] [will be presenting][l15] Haxe 
for JavaScript at CampJS. CampJS will take place between [20th and 23rd November 
2015 at Australia, Springbrook][l16].

Brendan also has added Haxe as an option to Khan Academies [Mobile Code Sharing 
Strategies at Khan Academy: A Comparative Analysis][l17] Google document. It might
have [sparked some interest][l18] in Khan Academies lead mobile developer, 
[Andy Matuschak][tw6].

[Ohmnivore][tw7] has started porting the JavaScript implementation of
_“Gabriel Gambetta's demo of client-side prediction and server reconciliation 
in networking”_ available from the apptly named [Client side prediction and 
Server reconciliation][l19] repository.

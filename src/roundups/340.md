# Haxe Roundup № 340

We will start off with, _probably_, the most important news from this week,
that Haxe `3.2.1` has been [released][l1] and is now available for [download][l2].
[Andy Li][tw1] has [tweeted][l3] the official, _alternative_ ways you can
install Haxe through some of the various package managers, homebrew and chocolatey, 
for example.

With the latest release of Haxe `3.2.1`, there have been a bunch of HaxeLib
updates and releases, here are a few:
	
- [PixiJS `3.0.25`][l4], a set of externs for pixi.js `v3`.
- [Haxpression `0.0.3`][l5], a basic math expression parser and evaluator.
- [Hxmeteor `0.2.0`][l6], which provides bindings and tools to use meteor.js with Haxe.
- [React `0.2.0`][l7], a set of externs and tools to use Facebook's React with Haxe.

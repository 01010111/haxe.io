# Haxe Roundup № 334

We have had another bunch of WWX2015 videos released by [Silex Labs][tw1] this
week:
	
- [NPM and Haxe at the heart of the JavaScript escosystem][l1] by [David Mouton][tw2]
- [Haxe Evangelism with Silex Labs][l2] by [Jean-Baptiste Richardet][tw3]
- [Haxe at Massive Interactive][l3] by [Philippe Elsass][tw4]
- [The Tech behind Evoland 2][l4] by [Nicolas Cannasse][tw5]
- [Continuous Integration for Haxe Projects][l5] by [Andy Li][tw6]
- [A walk-through of Haxe JS Kit][l6] by [Clément Charmet][tw7]

Alot has happened since WWX2015.

[Nicolas][tw5] and his studio, Shiro Games, have released Evoland 2, which is
available now from [GOG][l7], [Steam][l8] and the [Humble Store][l9].

[Andy][tw6] has since [joined the HaxeFoundation][l10] and continued to improve
Haxe online and offline, by speaking at events and recently by his
[Continuous Improvement on Continuous Integration for Haxe Projects][l11] article.
We are now able to test open source projects on OSX, Linux and Windows.

# Haxe Roundup № 334

We have had another bunch of WWX2015 videos released by [Silex Labs][tw1] this
week:
	
- [NPM and Haxe at the heart of the JavaScript escosystem][l1] by [David Mouton][tw2]
- [Haxe Evangelism with Silex Labs][l2] by [Jean-Baptiste Richardet][tw3]
- [Haxe at Massive Interactive][l3] by [Philippe Elsass][tw4]
- [The Tech behind Evoland 2][l4] by [Nicolas Cannasse][tw5]
- [Continuous Integration for Haxe Projects][l5] by [Andy Li][tw6]
- [A walk-through of Haxe JS Kit][l6] by [Clément Charmet][tw7]

Alot has happened since WWX2015.

[Nicolas][tw5] and his studio, Shiro Games, have released Evoland 2, which is
available now from [GOG][l7], [Steam][l8] and the [Humble Store][l9].

[Andy][tw6] has since [joined the HaxeFoundation][l10] and continued to improve
Haxe online and offline, by speaking at events and recently by his
[Continuous Improvement on Continuous Integration for Haxe Projects][l11] article.
We are now able to test open source projects on OSX, Linux and Windows.

Even though LudumDare ended almost two weeks ago, the [Haxe LudumDare 33 Roundup][l12]
has been released, _and at the time of this article being written_, there at 85
Haxe powered games. Also, this was the first article **not** written by me, all the
hard work was done by [Gama11][tw8].

[Sven Bergström][tw9] has also published an [LD33 Recap][l14] over on the snõwkit
community site.

Following LD33, Laguna has written [Shadowing your code][l13], which teaches you
how to code shadows to appear on your tilemaps without any dynamic shadow calculations.

Even though the following is a couple of weeks old and you've possibly already come
across it, it still needs **mentioning**. 

[Sven][tw9] has released [linc][l16] to the public. In Sven's [Announcing linc][l15] 
article, you are introduced to a set of Haxe HXCPP compatible extern libraries, 
SDL, OpenAL and stb being only a handful thats already available, with OpenGL 
and Steamwork externs indevelopment. These are **extern type definitions**, not
CFFI ndll's.

And it's not tided to a single framework, the _**entire**_ Haxe community can
benifit from this, not just from the extern defintions, but also for its documentation
and as examples on how to write native externs.

[James Gray][gh1] has published on GitHub [HXCPP Object Graph Viewer][l17], while
experimental but still really useful, allows you to track memory usage.

[Aaron Shea][tw10] has started working on a getting [PhysicsFS][19] working for 
HXCPP, available from the aptly named [haxefs][l18] GitHub repository. HaxeFS
will allow you to mount folders and archives to a virtual UNIX filesystem.

OpenFL and Away3D seem to have **exploded** back onto the scene this last week,
starting with [Jason Sturges][tw11], who has published the [OpenFL & Away3D Terrain
Demo][l20], which has been compiled to HTML5 and Flash. Jason also published the
[OpenFL & Away3D Actuate Demo][l21].

[Pete Shand][tw12] then followed up by releasing **four** articles:
	
- Use [Bitmap Fonts in OpenFL and Away3D][l22]
- [Load SWF/SWC Assets into Haxe Flash or HTML5 targets][l23]
- [Animate SWF Assets in Haxe Flash and HTML5 targets][l24]
- [Realtime Texture Packer for SWF Assets in Haxe Flash and HTML5 targets][l25]

[Fuz][tw13] finishes off the Away3D articles with his post [Multidimensional
Arrays in OpenFL and Away3D][l26].

[Jacob Albano][tw14] has started working on extending [Vadim's][tw15] PICO8
Haxe generator _“to make an API with a little more”_.

![PICO8 generator](/img/334/pico8.png "Adding sugar to the PICO8 Haxe API")

[Mike Almond][tw16] has released a _“step sequencer with a focus on randomisation”_,
available now through his [16-step, 8-track, drum sequencer demo][l27] and the
[source code][l28] also available. Mike used Haxe, PixiJS type definitions and
some material design.

[Mark Knol][tw17] has written a great article, [Bitwise operations made easy in 
Haxe][l29], in which Mark uses a abstract enum to improve the readability of 
bitwise operators, to create an optimised access flag.

[Rsredsq][tw18], while working on the Haxe [type definitions][l30] for the 
[Atomic Game Engine][l31] has created a special high performance vector math
library available from the [atomic-haxe-math][l32] repository.

[Franco Ponticelli][tw19] continues to add impressive features to his [thx][l33]
libraries, with his latest efforts being put to add [BigInts][l34] to Haxe, for **all**
compiler targets. `BigInt` is located in the [thx.core][l35] library.

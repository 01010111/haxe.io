# Haxe Roundup № 342

[Andy Li][tw5] continues to make Haxe available to **everyone** on _Linux distros_,
with his latest efforts getting Haxe onto Fedora and openSUSE, jump on over to
his post [Haxe RPM Packages for Fedora and openSUSE][l20] for more details.

Here are _just_ some of this weeks latest HaxeLib releases:
	
- [thx.core `0.37.1`][l1]
- [thx.unit `0.7.1`][l2]
- [thx.color `0.17.2`][l3]

    > `thx.*` libraries by [Franco Ponticelli][tw1] _“contain extensions to 
	many of the types contained in the standard library as well as new 
	complementary types”_ like colour manipulation and units of measurement.

- [tink_xml `0.2.0`][l4]
- [tink_priority `0.1.3`][l5]
- [tink_template `0.2.1`][l6]

    > `tink_*` libraries by [Juraj Kirchheim][tw2] are _“lightweight tools for 
	robust programming”_ with a pleasant Haxe esque API.

- [datetime `3.0.2`][l7]
- [HtmlParser `2.4.3`][l8]

    > A _“simple and fast crossplatform HTML/XML parser with a jQuery-like find()
	method”_.

- [jsfl `1.0.4`][l9]
- [HStat `1.0.1`][l10]
- [partials `1.0.0`][l11]

    > _“A simple macro library for writing classes as partials”_.

- [format `3.2.1`][l12]
- [Lime `2.70`][l13]
- [OpenFL `3.4.0`][l14]
- [Chrome-extension `46.0.0`][l15]
- [Chrome-app `46.0.0`][l16]
- [Hx-MathML `1.0.0`][l19]

    > An OpenFL _“implementation of MathML to display mathematical formulas”_ by
	[Ian Harrigan][tw4].

[Philippe Elsass][tw3] has started writting type definitions for [FuseTools][l18]
[over on GitHub][l17], which is _“a new, promising, tool for 
cross-platform mobile apps development”_.

[Tilman Schmidt][tw7] has created and published a brand new [linc][l22] library,
[linc_rtmidi][l23], which provides _“native HXCPP bindings for [RtMidi][l24]”_
on Mac, Linux and Windows.

With snõwkit getting Apple tvOS support [six weeks ago][l25] and OpenFL 
[two weeks later][l26], the various changes needed have slowly trickled down
and [GameDuell's][tw8] [duell tool][l28] has recieved its own tvOS plugin, 
available from [GitHub][l27].

It looks like the HaxeFlixel community will be getting a full time developer, of 
around 80 hours per month, which [Lars Doucet][l6] recent [Twitter Poll][l21] 
thread indicates.

There has been a bunch of game related new this week:
	
- Evoland 2 [won the innovation award][l29] at this years [EIGD][tw9].
- [Daniel Blaker][tw17] won a HP Envy at [STEM Video Game Challenge][tw41] for
[Phlight - The Journey Home][l42], created with HaxeFlixel.
- [PND][tw10] has released [Mu Complex][l30] onto Steam, in which you _“play as 
a hacker and take control of an ultra secret company to reveal the darkest 
secrets”_.
- [Joaquin Bello][tw11] releases HaxeFlixel game ingame preview of [Arcan Rage][l31],
with the art [created by the lead artist][l32] from Ironhide studios.
- A [#screenshotsaturday][l33] HaxeFlixel [prototype][l34] by [Ilija Melentijevic][tw12].
- A preview of [Tacticaler][l35] by [Juan Albansesi][tw13] using OpenFL and HaxeUI.
- A `#screenshotsaturday` luxe engine [preview][l36] by [Christian Frauenstein][tw14].
- A snõwkit powered library, [ChopEngine][l37], preview [showing][l38] `.obj` importing
and parsing by [Ohmnivore][tw15].
- [Eduardo Lopes][tw16] has written [devlog #6] and [devlog #7][l39] for Where's
My Dog, a game powered by luxe engine. The ingame style looks great.

Ian Harrigan's upcoming HaxeUI v2 [gets custom fonts and buttons][l43] for the
OpenFL and [luxe engine][l44] backends. Ian is currently running two polls,
[what version 2 backends are more useful to you?][l45] and [which platforms will
be more useful?][l46]. Also, the next time your on Facebook, head on over to
[HaxeUI's page][l47] for the latest progress update.

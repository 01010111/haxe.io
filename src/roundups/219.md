# Haxe Roundup № 219

[Kirill Poletaev][g+1] has created [haxecoder.com], a tutorial site for Haxe and
OpenFL, releasing a new tutorial _nearly_ every day.

![pakka](/img/219/pakka.png "@PakkaPets save restored from phone to desktop")

Another new site is [quaxe.org], created by [Daniel Glazman][tw1], which will
contain all of his Haxe thoughts, musings and ramblings. Currently he has posts
about working with [Waxe] which is Haxe and [wxWidgets] by [Hugh Sanderson][tw2].

[Jordan Wambaugh][tw3] has updated [TJSON], _“the tolerant JSON parser for Haxe”_. This
update makes TJSON thread safe and adds experimental class serialization.

Speaking of JSON class serialization, [Vadim Dyachenko][tw4] has posted an [experiment][l1],
showing his idea which tries to solve ordering, readability, typing and efficiency
which annoy him in existing implementations.

[Luaxe], a project [Vadim][tw4] has contributed to, which was created by [Oleg][gh2],
is a pre alpha Lua target for Haxe. Think of all the possibilities...

[Michel Käser][gh1] has publish his [Binary] static class, which is part of the larger
library [hx-lib]. Michel also shared his [thoughts][l2] on why he has depreciated
some of his open source libraries and released them. Michel has and continues to, 
release well documented and tested [libraries][l3].

There has been some recent-ish work from afew different people on a more robust
date time implementation for Haxe. The most recent and possibly the most robust
of them all is [DateTime] from [Alexander Kuzmenko][tw5]. 

By using Abstracts, Alexander is able to get a 7x speed increase over the standard 
library `Date` or an unfortunate 10x slow down on some platforms. DateTime supports
UTC dates and has a full timezone database available hidden behind
`-D FULL_TZDATA`.

A couple of interesting discussions have appeared on the mailing list, the first
[Documentation! That's what you need][l4] and the second
[Why don't more companies use Haxe?][l5].

A company that **does** use Haxe, effectively, is TiVo who have [reported][l9]
that using Haxe has increased _“performance on [their] TiVo Premiere boxes by 
over 30%”_ and _“reducing [their] research and development spend by 5%”_.

![locomotive](/img/219/loco.jpg "HaxeFlixel puzzle game by @LocomotiveMob")

A feature that is being worked on and added piece by piece to nightly builds of Haxe
is [Simon Krajewski's][gh4] work on implementing [Static Single Assignment][l10]. The
point of SSA is that it _“simplifies and improves the results of a variety of 
compiler optimizations”_. You can use the recently added constant propagation by using
a [nightly build][l11] and adding `-D analyzer` to your `hxml` file.

Apparently people have had success with running FlashDevelop on Linux/Mac using
[CrossOver] a commercial version of Wine. The FlashDevelop team have put
out a [call for help][l6] to users to test on Linux and Mac.

The [Proletariat Inc][tw6] team has published [Goodbye MUnit][l7] in which
they ditch MUnit for their own library [Haxe NodeUnit][l8] while testing
their game World Zombination.

While on the unit test topic, [John Beech][gh3] has created [hxpect] a _“framework
for writing tests in natural language”_. Think `expect(true).to.be(true)` and
your good to go.

[Kyle Travis][gh5] has created [Haxe Hardware] which is an OpenFL extension for 
Android which gives to access to information about the device, currently supporting
screen width and height getters and with the ability to make the device vibrate.

[Tong][tw7] has [shared][l12] a photo of a multicopter drone, controlled using XMPP.
He has also been busy creating a [tonne][l13] of JavaScript externs, [tween](https://github.com/tong/tween.hx),
[om](https://github.com/tong/om) are just a couple.
	
And to finish off this roundup, have a couple of newly released games [Quad][l14]
by [Jonathan Bennetts][tw8] and [Linker][l15] by [Aaron Styles][tw9].

# Haxe Roundup № 339

There are a three Haxe related events upcoming within the couple of months.

- [Haxe, a language that compiles to JavaScript][l1] by [Andy Li][tw1] on Thursday 15th October 2015
- [Code Of War][l3] by [David Mouton][tw3] with registration closing on Thursday 5th November 2015
- [Haxe and JavaScript at CampJS][l2] by [Brendan Graetz][tw2] between 20th-23rd November 2015

Brendan's talk actually still needs to be [voted for][l4], so quickly pop on over
and vote for him! It litterally takes seconds. 

Also, to make sure his talk will cover everything Haxe JS,
he's [looking for your thoughts and suggestions][l5] on the topic.

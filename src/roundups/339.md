# Haxe Roundup № 339

There are a three Haxe related events upcoming within the couple of months.

- [Haxe, a language that compiles to JavaScript][l1] by [Andy Li][tw1] on Thursday 15th October 2015
- [Code Of War][l3] by [David Mouton][tw3] with registration closing on Thursday 5th November 2015
- [Haxe, a statically-typed language that compiles to Python _(and more)_ at PyCON HK 2015][l6] by Andy Li between 7th-8th November 2015
- [Haxe and JavaScript at CampJS][l2] by [Brendan Graetz][tw2] between 20th-23rd November 2015

Andy Li has written more about the two talks he will be giving [over on his blog][l7].

Brendan's talk actually still needs to be [voted for][l4], so quickly pop on over
and vote for him! It literally takes seconds. 

Also, to make sure his talk will cover everything Haxe JS,
he's [looking for your thoughts and suggestions][l5] on the topic, and some
help on how to [install Haxe, OpenFL and HaxeFlixel offline][l10].

In between his talks, Andy Li has also been working on improving Haxe support on
[Debian and Ubunutu][l8] OS's. Fedora is aparantently the next OS to get an
_“offical”_ package, with Ubuntu also planned to get an automated nightly
build PPA!

AND Andy has a [Haxe usage survey][l9] currently in progress, a quick 10 question
form that will help Andy and the Haxe Foundation understand the dedicated Haxe
community. Of course, Andy will publish his results to his site when its complete.

[Robert Konrad][tw4] has released Kha `15.10`, available from [HaxeLib][l11]. In
his [announcement article][l12], Robert has added Direct3D 12 support, OSX 10.11
support and direct AGAL support to Krafix.

An oldie but a classic, Castle Siege by [Lubos Lenco][tw5] has been recreated using
Kha and the updates have been made live for [iOS][l12] and [Android][l13]. The earliest
roundup I could find that mentions Castle Siege was in [issue 97][l14]! and it appears
it was originally made with NME, 3 years ago.

While we are on HaxeLib updates, here are afew more:
	
- [NME][l15] `5.5.2`
- [Lime][l16] `2.6.8`
- [OpenFL][l17] `3.3.8`
- [SWF][l18] `2.1.1`
- [Duell][l19] `4.0.18`
- [Chrome-Extension][l20] `45.0.1`
- [Chrome-App][l21] `45.0.2`

Not a _HaxeLib_ release, but just as important, [HxScout][tw11] `0.5.0` is out, 
_“faster, fixed close-session-crash & new additions to user guide”_ is available
now to [download][l32].

[Joshua Granick][tw6] has posted over on the OpenFL blog [October Development Update][l22]
which highlights **just** some of the new features and fixes that have landed in
the various OpenFL repositories over the last few months, covering Lime `2.6.8`,
OpenFL `3.3.8` and SWF `2.1.1`.

One particular update to the OpenFL family is the [custom plugin][l23] for Flash 
CC, because of the recent additions to SWF HaxeLib. [Lars Doucet][tw7] has 
[tweeted][l24] an example of a Flash CC project compiled to native C++, with
the [source code on GitHub][l25].

OpenFL also has inprogress Apple tvOS support, contributed by [Valerio Santinelli][tw12]
who had been documenting his progress over on the OpenFL [forums][l33]. Valerio
has contributed source to [HXCPP][l34], [Lime][l35] and [OpenFL][l36].

Mino Monsters 2: Evolution, created with Haxe and OpenFL has been released, available
now for [iOS][l26] and [Android][l27]. [Sash MacKinnon][tw8] and [Josh Buckley][tw9]
of [Mino Games][l29] have also [raised $2.2M in funding][l28].

And the start of the OpenFL [merchandise][l30] starts **now**.

If your new to Haxe and OpenFL, and happen to be using a Mac, there is a handy
tutorial out this week called [Haxe & OpenFL on Mac - A quick start for 
mobile development][l31] by the [InfoHeap][tw10] team.

If your planning on only targeting Android with Haxe and OpenFL, over on the
Intel Developer Zone you can read about [Haxe Toolkit: Compilation for Intel x86
for the Android Platform][l42]. In the article they appear to be using an **older**
version of Haxe, HXCPP and OpenFL.

This weeks set of videos are **all** OpenFL related.

- [Haxe & Lime 3D Particles, BillBoard & Grass system][l37-34] by [Djoker][tw13]
- [Haxe Terrain GeoMipMap][l37-39] by Djoker
- [Haxe, OpenFL and HaxeFlixel MODE running on Apple tvOS][l38] by [Valerio Santinelli][tw12]
- [Raspberry Pi Touch Display with OpenFL][l39-71] by [Patrick Gutlich][tw14]

Patrick has also written about [Using the Raspberry Pi Touch Display with OpenFL][l40]
and about [Using the GPIO ports with OpenFL][l41], which was featured in last weeks
roundup.

[Ian Harrigan][tw15] has [published][l43] a preview of HaxeUI v2 supporting
9-slice skinning for the OpenFL renderer, with other backends being updated soon.
You can try out the OpenFL 9-slice support via the HaxeUI v2 [demo][l44]

[Nick][tw17] has written about the engine that powers Enki Adventures in the article
[One Big Parsing Engine][l49]. It _just_ makes sense. Under the hood, Nick uses
OpenFL and HaxeFlixel.

There have been two game releases in the last week:
	
- [The Great Block!][l48] by [Nachofries][tw16] for Android
- [Sky Troops][l45] by Arnaud Dagnelies which was [announced][l46] over on the Haxe mailing list and made [open source][l47], created with CreateJS

[Silvio][gh1] has written how to hook into the flow build tool, _which is part of the
snõwkit collective_, in his article [Luxe/Flow Hooks Example][l50].

[Andrei Rudenko][tw18] has created a sunflower seed generator using luxe engine 
and mínt, _both part of the snõwkit collective_, which you can [try out now][l51]!

Andy Li has written more about the two talks he will be giving [over on his blog][l7].

Brendan's talk actually still needs to be [voted for][l4], so quickly pop on over
and vote for him! It literally takes seconds. 

Also, to make sure his talk will cover everything Haxe JS,
he's [looking for your thoughts and suggestions][l5] on the topic.

In between his talks, Andy Li has also been working on improving Haxe support on
[Debian and Ubunutu][l8] OS's. Fedora is aparantently the next OS to get an
_“offical”_ package, with Ubuntu also planned to get an automated nightly
build PPA!

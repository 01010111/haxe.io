# Haxe Roundup № 339

There are a three Haxe related events upcoming within the couple of months.

- [Haxe, a language that compiles to JavaScript][l1] by [Andy Li][tw1] on Thursday 15th October 2015
- [Code Of War][l3] by [David Mouton][tw3] with registration closing on Thursday 5th November 2015
- [Haxe, a statically-typed language that compiles to Python _(and more)_ at PyCON HK 2015][l6] by Andy Li between 7th-8th November 2015
- [Haxe and JavaScript at CampJS][l2] by [Brendan Graetz][tw2] between 20th-23rd November 2015

Andy Li has written more about the two talks he will be giving [over on his blog][l7].

Brendan's talk actually still needs to be [voted for][l4], so quickly pop on over
and vote for him! It literally takes seconds. 

Also, to make sure his talk will cover everything Haxe JS,
he's [looking for your thoughts and suggestions][l5] on the topic, and some
help on how to [install Haxe, OpenFL and HaxeFlixel offline][l10].

In between his talks, Andy Li has also been working on improving Haxe support on
[Debian and Ubunutu][l8] OS's. Fedora is aparantently the next OS to get an
_“offical”_ package, with Ubuntu also planned to get an automated nightly
build PPA!

AND Andy has a [Haxe usage survey][l9] currently in progress, a quick 10 question
form that will help Andy and the Haxe Foundation understand the dedicated Haxe
community. Of course, Andy will publish his results to his site when its complete.

[Robert Konrad][tw4] has released Kha `15.10`, available from [HaxeLib][l11]. In
his [announcement article][l12], Robert has added Direct3D 12 support, OSX 10.11
support and direct AGAL support to Krafix.

An oldie but a classic, Castle Siege by [Lubos Lenco][tw5] has been recreated using
Kha and the updates have been made live for [iOS][l12] and [Android][l13]. The earliest
roundup I could find that mentions Castle Siege was in [issue 97][l14]! and it appears
it was originally made with NME, 3 years ago.

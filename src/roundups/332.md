# Haxe Roundup № 332

To start this weeks roundup off, [Romuald Halasz][tw1] has written an introductory
post titled [Haxe - A toolkit for cross-platform developement][l1], useful for 
people unfamiliar with Haxe and transpilers in general.

> This meant that if you wanted your app to run on multiple platforms, it have to 
be developed in accordance with each platform’s specifications. Usually, this 
meant developing an app for each platform you wanted to support. Naturally, 
developers wondered if there was a way to develop an app once (i.e. write the code),
but deploy it to multiple platforms.

Of course, Haxe is _just_ one solution to this problem.

[Benjamin Dasnois][tw2] has created [Braxet][l2], an extension _“for the 
increasingly popular [Brackets][l3]”_ IDE. You will find a quick and easy guide
to getting started with the Braxet extension in Benjamin's [article][l2].

[Lubos Lenco][tw3] has published _yet_ another sneak peek of his prototype game
editor powered by Kha, this time, _running_ in the browser.

If your interested in UI that appears in Lubos's various teasers, it turns out it's
an open source library he has recently released called [zui][l4], specifically made
for the Kha framework.

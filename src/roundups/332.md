# Haxe Roundup № 332

To start this weeks roundup off, [Romuald Halasz][tw1] has written an introductory
post titled [Haxe - A toolkit for cross-platform developement][l1], useful for 
people unfamiliar with Haxe and transpilers in general.

> This meant that if you wanted your app to run on multiple platforms, it have to 
be developed in accordance with each platform’s specifications. Usually, this 
meant developing an app for each platform you wanted to support. Naturally, 
developers wondered if there was a way to develop an app once (i.e. write the code),
but deploy it to multiple platforms.

Of course, Haxe is _just_ one solution to this problem.

[Benjamin Dasnois][tw2] has created [Braxet][l2], an extension _“for the 
increasingly popular [Brackets][l3]”_ IDE. You will find a quick and easy guide
to getting started with the Braxet extension in Benjamin's [article][l2].

[Lubos Lenco][tw3] has published _yet_ another sneak peek of his prototype game
editor powered by Kha, this time, _running_ in the browser.

If your interested in UI that appears in Lubos's various teasers, it turns out it's
an open source library he has recently released called [zui][l4], specifically made
for the Kha framework.

While on the topic of IDE's and editors, [Lars Doucet][tw4] has documented how
to get FlashDevelop [running on a Mac][l5] via CrossOver.

A game editor which doesnt get as much attention as it should is [GameStudioHx][l6]
by [Krtolica Vujadin][tw5], has been used to created [The Truck Driver][l7] available
now on Newgrounds.

One more editor sneak peek, this time from [Haxor Engine][tw6], who appears to be
working on an 3D editor, possibly called Haxor Studio.

Continuing on from [last weeks][l8] impressive luxe engine news, featured over on 
the snõwkit community site, the first luxe engine powered Android game,
Profectus.4, has been published to the [Google Play Store][l9].

[Juno Nguyen][tw7], the creator of Profectus.4, has published [What I learned about
luxe on Android][l10] over on the snõwkit community site. _That title says it all really_.

[Sven Bergstrom][tw8] has posted the long awaited snõwkit dev log, [issue 6][l11], 
which covers updates to the asset packer, mínt, the much anticipated UI library, 
_framework agnostic of course_ and coverage of the **increasing** amount of community 
contributions, like [Darek Greenly's][tw9] _Rush_ built with luxe engine shown below.

Another GBJam entry is from [Vadim][tw10], who in last weeks [issue 331][l8]
introduced the PICO8 Haxe compiler target, has uploaded a teaser showing a
colour blind lizard.

Lets framework switch over to Lime/OpenFL.

The team from [Shark Punch][tw11] game, The Masterplan, have won the **Best Game Design**
Indie Prize award at [Casual Connect][tw12]!

![the masterplan openfl lime](/img/332/themasterplan.jpg "@SharkPunchHQ win the Best Game Design Indie Prize award!")

The [latest release of OpenFL][l12], version `3.3`, includes _“a new TextField class with 
a huge list of improvements — better accuracy, support for all methods and 
native text input!”_

[Lime][l13], version `2.5.3`, the layer _beneath_ OpenFL, has also been updated with
_“a new Display API, Clipboard support, better touch event support and renewed 
compatibility with JNI for Android extensions”_.

[Subterrarium][l14] by [Taylor Anderson][tw13], built with [HaxePunk][l15], is
_“a procedurally generated puzzle game about soda, jetpacks and plants. Buy soda 
from vending machines, make beautiful gardens underground, and trigger cave-ins to 
climb to the surface”_.

The [Silex Labs][tw14] team has been releasing steadily WWX2015 videos, heres the latest
bunch from the last week.

- [Slapping data from web servers right in your GPU][l16] by David Elahee
- [Lime/OpenFL for home game consoles][l17] by Lars Doucet
- [The MOKICK Story][l18] by Markus Raab

Non game related topics, like Markus's CMS work, really help highlight Haxe's
other, _obvious_, but under talked about use cases. The same goes for **all** 
the WWX2015 videos from [issue № 330][l19]. But this doesnt mean you should
side step any game related video, as any one can learn from the technical 
challenages faced in those videos.

[Ivan Malopinsky][tw15] has released [Haxe `3.2` for Docker][l20] allowing you to
run Haxe in an isolated, consistent environment across any platform.

[Franco Ponticelli][tw16] has created a new `DateTime` abstract **type** in 
[thx.core][l21], the _“generic multi-purpose library [which] aims to be the 
[lodash][l22] library for Haxe”_. I recommend you check the 
[test cases for DateTime][l23] for a decent introduction to its use.

> `DateTime` represents an instant in time since about year 29228 B.C.E. up to
29228 C.E. (A.D.). `DateTime` supports a resolution up to 1e7th of second (a tick) 
and has **no precision issues** since it is mapped internally to a `Int64`. 
`DateTime` also supports a time offset to describe time zone values.

[Tong][tw17] has released his [digital clock for Atom.io][l24], which will appear
in the status bar. And _of course_ its [written in Haxe][l25].

To finish this weeks roundup off, is a preview from [Michael Bickel][tw18]
showing his 3D engine, Foo3D, running ontop of snõw.

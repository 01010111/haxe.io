# Haxe Roundup № 332

To start this weeks roundup off, [Romuald Halasz][tw1] has written an introductory
post titled [Haxe - A toolkit for cross-platform developement][l1], useful for 
people unfamiliar with Haxe and transpilers in general.

> This meant that if you wanted your app to run on multiple platforms, it have to 
be developed in accordance with each platform’s specifications. Usually, this 
meant developing an app for each platform you wanted to support. Naturally, 
developers wondered if there was a way to develop an app once (i.e. write the code),
but deploy it to multiple platforms.

Of course, Haxe is _just_ one solution to this problem.

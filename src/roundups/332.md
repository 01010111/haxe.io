# Haxe Roundup № 332

To start this weeks roundup off, [Romuald Halasz][tw1] has written an introductory
post titled [Haxe - A toolkit for cross-platform developement][l1], useful for 
people unfamiliar with Haxe and transpilers in general.

> This meant that if you wanted your app to run on multiple platforms, it have to 
be developed in accordance with each platform’s specifications. Usually, this 
meant developing an app for each platform you wanted to support. Naturally, 
developers wondered if there was a way to develop an app once (i.e. write the code),
but deploy it to multiple platforms.

Of course, Haxe is _just_ one solution to this problem.

[Benjamin Dasnois][tw2] has created [Braxet][l2], an extension _“for the 
increasingly popular [Brackets][l3]”_ IDE. You will find a quick and easy guide
to getting started with the Braxet extension in Benjamin's [article][l2].

[Lubos Lenco][tw3] has published _yet_ another sneak peek of his prototype game
editor powered by Kha, this time, _running_ in the browser.

If your interested in UI that appears in Lubos's various teasers, it turns out it's
an open source library he has recently released called [zui][l4], specifically made
for the Kha framework.

While on the topic of IDE's and editors, [Lars Doucet][tw4] has documented how
to get FlashDevelop [running on a Mac][l5] via CrossOver.

A game editor which doesnt get as much attention as it should is [GameStudioHx][l6]
by [Krtolica Vujadin][tw5], has been used to created [The Truck Driver][l7] available
now on Newgrounds.

One more editor sneak peek, this time from [Haxor Engine][tw6], who appears to be
working on an 3D editor, possibly called Haxor Studio.

Continuing on from [last weeks][l8] impressive luxe engine news, featured over on 
the snõwkit community site, the first luxe engine powered Android game,
Profectus.4, has been published to the [Google Play Store][l9].

[Juno Nguyen][tw7], the creator of Profectus.4, has published [What I learned about
luxe on Android][l10] over on the snõwkit community site. _That title says it all really_.

[Sven Bergstrom][tw8] has posted the long awaited snõwkit dev log, [issue 6][l11], 
which covers updates to the asset packer, mínt, the much anticipated UI library, 
_framework agnostic of course_ and coverage of the **increasing** amount of community 
contributions, like [Darek Greenly's][tw9] _Rush_ built with luxe engine shown below.

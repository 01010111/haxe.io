# Haxe Roundup № 328

While there is still time, the current [Humble Bundle][l1], _the Game Making bundle_,
which contains 22 programs, including [Stencyl][l2] which uses Haxe and OpenFL
under the hood, is available in the bundle with an included **Indie** subscription
worth `$99`.

If your new to Haxe and OpenFL, or just need a refresher, [Lewis Lepton][gh1] has
created the [OpenFL Know How Wiki][[l3], a _“place for anyone to learn & bone up 
on knowledge of Haxe/OpenFL”_.

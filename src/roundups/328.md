# Haxe Roundup № 328

While there is still time, the current [Humble Bundle][l1], _the Game Making bundle_,
which contains 22 programs, including [Stencyl][l2] which uses Haxe and OpenFL
under the hood, is available in the bundle with an included **Indie** subscription
worth `$99`.

If your new to Haxe and OpenFL, or just need a refresher, [Lewis Lepton][gh1] has
created the [OpenFL Know How Wiki][[l3], a _“place for anyone to learn & bone up 
on knowledge of Haxe/OpenFL”_.

Once you've have gotten (re)actuainted with Haxe and OpenFL, how about reading
[Fuz's][tw1] tutorial on how to [Create random maze's with Haxe and OpenFL][l4].

[Lars Doucet][tw2] continues to implement futher controller support to HaxeFlixel 
with the most recent adding [support for Wii][l6] controllers. Checkout the preview
showing [Wii remote input mapped to a Xbox controller][l5].

The [Chimango Games][tw3] team have released their game [Gum Ball: Sewer Sweater 
Search][l7] made for the Cartoon Network built with HaxeFlixel.

[Ian Harrigan][tw4] tweeted a couple of previews for HaxeUI `v2` which can
run on either [OpenFL or Flambe][l8] using the same `.xml` definition. Ian has
also created a [binding demo][l9] which you can try, based on HaxeUI `v2` code.

Maybe a backend which could be added to HaxeUI `v2`, is Kha, by [Robert Konrad][tw5],
who has recently made Kha available for download through HaxeLib. Robert has
written a post about [Kha on HaxeLib][l10] giving you a brief intro, as well as
some known issues and future details.

If your interested in Kha, [Lubos Lenco][tw6] has finished his [Haxe and Kha 3D 
Guide][l11], a set of tutorials which teach you how _“to use modern, 
cross-platform 3D graphics API provided by Kha”_.

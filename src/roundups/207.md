# Haxe Roundup № 207

[Highwayman][l1] Stars belong to you, created by [Chau Guillaume][tw1] and 
François Rousset using Haxe, OpenFL and HaxeFlixel have made a _“space-opera
RPG made by a small team of two french students”_. Highwayman was made for
the 2014 [Indie Game Maker Contest][l2] where you can [vote][l2] for them.

![haxe highwayman social](/img/207/Beacon.png "Highwayman | Hello?")

[Michel Käser][tw2] has been busy, working on and releasing two Neko and HXCPP
compatible extensions [hxcurl] and [hxsnappy].

![haxe hxcurl](/img/207/hxcurl.mp4 "HxCurl Download Progress")

[Hxcurl], as you might be have guessed, provides bindings for the Neko and CPP
compile targets of libcurl. [Hxsnappy] provides Neko and CPP compile target bindings 
for the [Snappy] compression library, which is largely use by Google. These are
great contributions to the Haxe community.

[David Bindloss][tw3] has written [Haxe Tutorial 1: Starting Out][l3] which guides
someone completely new to Haxe through installing, setting up, writing and compiling
their Hello World Haxe program.

[Haxor Engine][tw4] which combines the power of WebGL and Haxe has moved all their
open source repositories to [GitHub][l4] and have created and release two new 
repositories, [peerhx] and [lzmahx].

[PeerHx] is a extern type definition port of the [PeerJs] library which _“provides
a complete, configurable and easy to use peer-to-peer API built on top of WebRTC”_.

[Lzmahx] is also an extern type definition port of the [LZMA-JS] library  which _“
is a JavaScript implementation of the Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain (LZMA) compression 
algorithm”_.

[Luiz Paulo Bills][tw4] has written [Haxe Tips #1][l5] showing you how to declare
constants and read-only variables.

And if you want a [typesafe] EventDispatcher in Haxe then you can thank
[Juraj Kirchheim][tw5] for the abstract which _“makes the API suck a little less”_.

[Mark Knol][tw6] has [added][l6] a TexturePacker support for Flambe which was spawned
by [this Flambe issue][l7].

Another mobile game created with Haxe and Adobe Air has been released, called 
Soccer Crush, which merges puzzle and sport games together, is available on
[App Store] and [Play Store] created by [Bastien Levasseur][tw7].

And I'll finish with another image from Highwayman because its beautiful.

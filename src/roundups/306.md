![wwx 2015 social](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

The [Silex Labs][tw6] folks have [tweeted][l9] that they are looking for speakers 
for this years upcoming WWX2015 conference. If your interested, you should create
a pitch over on the Thaxe Force [mailing list][l10].

[Alex Koz][tw7] has also [annoucned][l11] he is looking for speakers for [DevGAMM][tw8] 
in Moscow, Russia on the 15th / 16th of May 2015.

[Philippe Elsass][tw1] from Massive Interactive has [stated][l1] that they are rewriting
the YouView UI, an internet TV service here in the UK, for SONY's next gen TV's
using Haxe and their Multi Screen Development Kit (MDK). You unfortuantly need to 
sign into LinkedIn to get to that post.

[Nicolas Cannasse][tw2] who's part of [Shiro Games][tw3] has released Evoland
onto [iOS][l2] and [Android][l3].

[François Nicaise][tw4] has released a [demo][l4] of his upcoming, work in progress
game, Better Human Consortium. The premise is that _“private data has been stolen 
by a malevolent company. You are a hacker. You need to find codes to log in their 
central server and free the data”_. François also has a [Patreon][l5] page, you should
support him if you can.

[Adi Reddy Mora][tw5] recently posted a link to a Haxe compiled [demo][l6] built ontop
of Pixi.js, a 2D WebGL renderer, based on the famous BunnyMark performance
_benchmarketing_. I fell for it, the performance increase is amazing.

[Slava Tretyak][tw5] has created a work in progress [particle emitter][l7] for OpenFL.

[Game Popper][tw10] has created and released MAN-Haxe, available on
[Haxelib][l13] and [GitHub][ll4], which provides a _“set of Maze and Noise 
algorithm classes that can generate 2D array or string maps”_.

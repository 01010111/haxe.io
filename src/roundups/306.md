# Haxe Roundup № 306

[Philippe Elsass][tw1] from Massive Interactive has [stated][l1] that they are rewriting
the YouView UI, an internet TV service here in the UK, for SONY's next gen TV's
using Haxe and their Multi Screen Development Kit (MDK). You unfortuantly need to 
sign into LinkedIn to get to that post.

[Nicolas Cannasse][tw2] who's part of [Shiro Games][tw3] has released Evoland
onto [iOS][l2] and [Android][l3].

[François Nicaise][tw4] has released a [demo][l4] of his upcoming, work in progress
game, Better Human Consortium. The premise is that _“private data has been stolen 
by a malevolent company. You are a hacker. You need to find codes to log in their 
central server and free the data”_. François also has a [Patreon][l5] page, you should
support him if you can.

[Adi Reddy Mora][tw5] recently posted a link to a Haxe compiled [demo][l6] built ontop
of Pixi.js, a 2D WebGL renderer, based on the famous BunnyMark performance
_benchmarketing_. I fell for it, the performance increase is amazing.

# Haxe Roundup № 215

[Nicolas][tw1] will be talking about Haxe at [GameDuell][l1] on Wednesday 10th 
September in Berlin, so if your able to attend, you need to [register][l2] your
interest in going.

In response to a Hacker News [question][l3] about programming languages which allow 
types that represent units, [Jason][tw2] replies by [showing][l4] how Haxe's Abstract
types can be used to represent units of measurement, by _“providing inline, implicit
conversion and keeping your from getting your units mixed up”_.

Because of [Jason's][tw2] code example, [Valentin][gh1] has started the [units][l5]
GitHub repository which currently provides Abstract types for Bit, Byte, Kilobit and
the rest.

Another library which provides various Abstracts is [Cauê's][tw3] [geotools][l6]
repository which provides _“dependency-free, straight-to-the-point Haxe geo tools”_,
has [units][l7] for seconds, minutes, radians and more. It also provides [UnixDate][l8]
and [TzDate][l9] abstracts.

[Heinz][tw4] has created and released [angular.haxe][l10]. Heinz describes it as
trying _“to combine angular.js with the type safety of haxe as much as possible.
The angular API is fully typed and haxe macros extend the api to support 
dependency injection based on types instead of unsafe strings”_. The README is well
written and provides code snippets of angular.js vs angular.haxe.

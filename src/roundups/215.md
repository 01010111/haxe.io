# Haxe Roundup № 215

[Nicolas][tw1] will be talking about Haxe at [GameDuell][l1] on Wednesday 10th 
September in Berlin, so if you're able to attend, you need to [register][l2] your
interest in going. Also head over to the Haxe mailing list where some people
attending the event have started a [thread][l19].

In response to a Hacker News [question][l3] about programming languages which allow 
types that represent units, [Jason][tw2] replies by [showing][l4] how Haxe's abstract
types can be used to represent units of measurement, by _“providing inline, implicit
conversion and keeping you from getting your units mixed up”_.

Because of [Jason's][tw2] code example, [Valentin][gh1] has started the [units][l5]
GitHub repository which currently provides abstract types for Bit, Byte, Kilobit and
the others.

Another library which provides various abstracts is [Cauê's][tw3] [geotools][l6]
repository which provides _“dependency-free, straight-to-the-point Haxe geo tools”_,
which contains [units][l7] for seconds, minutes, radians and more. It also provides
[UnixDate][l8] and [TzDate][l9] abstracts.

[Heinz][tw4] has created and released [angular.haxe][l10]. Heinz describes it as
trying _“to combine angular.js with the type safety of Haxe as much as possible.
The angular API is fully typed and Haxe macros extend the api to support 
dependency injection based on types instead of unsafe strings”_. The README is well
written and provides code snippets of angular.js vs angular.haxe.

[Daniel][tw5], a CSS working group co-chairman of the W3C, is [creating][l11] a 
conformant CSS parser and resolver, complete with an implementation of the 
CSS object model in pure Haxe, which will be open sourced in the future.

Over on the Haxe mailing list the topic of [supporting multi line strings][l12] came
up, with people giving various answers, but [Andy Li][tw6] replies with a 
[macro][l13] solution which uses comments and which even supports 
[string interpolation][l14]. Pure brilliance.

[Mike][tw7] has created and released [UMDWrap][l15] which allows you to _“Wrap 
compiled Haxe JS output for use as a self-contained module compatible 
with the UMD pattern”_.

[Dario][gh2] shared on the Haxe mailing list a library he created called [Haxdroid],
which _“converts Android XML UI layout to HaxeUI and brings the Android resource
manager to OpenFL”_.

[Tim][tw8] has written an in depth tutorial on [making a custom preloader][l16] for
HaxeFlixel, making sure to point out past tutorials are obviously out of date due to
the development speed of HaxeFlixel.

[Sidar][tw9] has released a [demo] of [Khapunk] which shows full shader support, 
which is itself a port of HaxePunk using the [Kha] framework, an alternative 
to OpenFL and Lime.

Recently, [Boyan][tw10] has been [granted][l17] access to the IntelliJ IDEA Haxe
plugin repository, so he can now push updates and fixes to the official repository 
which will result in faster releases.

There is another Haxe job [posting][l20] located in Dubai.

And to finish this weeks roundup, [Michael][tw11] shows a [preview][l18] of 
some progress he has been making on his open source projects.

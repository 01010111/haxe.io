# Haxe Roundup № 354

Welcome to the latest edition of the Haxe Roundup. [Haxe](http://haxe.org/?utm_source=haxe.io) is a high level, strictly typed programming language and cross-compiler.

## News from the Community

### News and Articles

This week has seen two big releases, _in each libraries own right_. 

HaxeFlixel `4.0.0` has _finally_ been [released](http://haxeflixel.com/blog/03-HaxeFlixel-4-0-0/) and snõw has progressed to `alpha-2.0`, with a large [architechual change](http://snowkit.org/2016/02/15/snow-alpha-2-0-changelog/).

[JeriX](https://twitter.com/JeriXNet) has created [svipt](https://github.com/JeriXNet/svipt), a command line tool that _“takes
svg file as an input to prepare app icon files for different platforms”_. I
could see other frameworks including this in their build processes.

[Sven Bergström](https://twitter.com/___discovery) has started yet _another_ project, to document HXCPP! The [HXCPP guide](https://github.com/snowkit/hxcpp-guide) has only just been created, 
but its already got alot of valuable information in it. Keep an eye on the [issues](https://github.com/snowkit/hxcpp-guide/issues), as [Lars Doucet](https://twitter.com/larsiusprime) has written down all his HXCPP
CFFI knowledge which he used to get the SteamWrap library working.

Haxe is _the target_ for a recently announced open source project [jtransc](https://github.com/jtransc/jtransc),
which was announced on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/haxelang/New$20opensource$20project$3A$20jtransc$20(kotlin$2Fjvm$20-%3E$20haxe)/haxelang/Ni_dIWsL94k/F8mJOOPbDQAJ). It converts [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) by Jetbrains using 
to generate Haxe code. Nuts.

- [Woot Math](https://twitter.com/wootmath), which helps kids learn fraction [uses](https://twitter.com/Jeff__Ward/status/697477181732052993) Haxe's `hscript` library, Adobe Air and Starling, via [Jeff Ward](https://twitter.com/Jeff__Ward/).
- HaxeLive `1.3` [released](http://www.colour-id.co.uk/news/haxelive-13-released-live-preview-native-ui-sort-of)! Live preview native UI... _sort of_ by [Luke](https://twitter.com/tienery).
- Using Adobe CC with OpenFL [discussion](http://community.openfl.org/t/feedback-creating-a-flash-html5-app-with-flashcc-openfl/7385) by [Ludovic Bas](https://twitter.com/loudoweb).
- Get [PiratePig Running on a Raspberry Pi 2](http://www.gepatto.nl/get-piratepig-running-on-a-raspberry-pi-2-with-raspbian-jessie/) with Raspbain Jessie by [Patrick Gutlich](https://twitter.com/gepatto).

_Opinionated Sidenote_. I was surprised and impressed by the HaxeFlixel teams openness 
and transparency when it comes to their [finances](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/haxeflixel.com/tree/master/src/files/finances).

### Events

- WWX2016 [Haxe Conference](https://github.com/silexlabs/wwx2016) at Mozilla Paris between 27th-30th May.

+	Add an [upcoming event](https://github.com/skial/haxe.io/labels/events) which _will_ be about Haxe.

### Jobs

- Massive Interactive looking for [Haxe & .NET developers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/haxelang/rofptaPdRQg/fk661KE3CQAJ) in London and Prague.

### Game Releases

- [Evil Dead: The evil cartridge](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/670612) created with OpenFL by [Joaquin Bello](https://twitter.com/JoaquinBelloD).

### Previews, Demos & Snippets

As usual, [Lubos Lenco](https://twitter.com/luboslenco/) has shared two _amazing_
previews of his in-progress Kha Blender engine, [Cycles](http://cyclesgame.org/). The first showing
[image based rendering](https://twitter.com/luboslenco/status/697855899394826240), the 
second showing a cerberus gun using [physically based rendering](https://twitter.com/luboslenco/status/698891413262635008).

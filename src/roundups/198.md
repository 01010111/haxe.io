# Haxe Roundup № 198

A brand new target has been added to Haxe, thanks to [Frabbit][gh1] and 
[Simon Krajewski][gh2] who have created the [Python target][l2]. You can grab 
a [nightly build][l3] to test it out.

![python](/img/198/haxepython.png "Haxe compiled to Python!")

The HaxeFlixel team have [released][l1] HaxeFlixel `3.3.0`, a huge release with improved
HTML5 support, further improvements to the debugger, gamepad support and loads more. The
improved HTML5 support comes to HaxeFlixel which now defaults to using [openfl-bitfive].

The OpenFL team have also been improving the HTML5 target with two beta releases, [1.4.1]
and [1.4.2]. 

The `1.4.1` release has seen investment in DOM support in which older devices perform
better than using Canvas and for applications designed only to re-render when a
change occurs. 

`1.4.2` introduces two new features, `flash.media.Video` and `openfl.display.DOMSprite`.

`Video` allows you to play and use HTML5 video and `DOMSprite` allows you to take 
any DOM element so acts like a `Sprite`, meaning you can move, fade, 
rotate and manipulate the DOM element as part of you display list.

Here is a HaxeFlixel made game, not using the new HTML5 output is [Bubble Shooter Twist][l4]
targeting Android.

And another Android game, [Spike: A Love Story][l5] made with HaxePunk by [Michael Houser][tw1].

[Aymeric Lamboley][tw2] has written [Flambe vs The World][l6] in which he describes
how he came to the decision for using Flambe for a new game called [Witchcraft Works][l7]
that had to work in mobile browsers. 

Aymeric also goes onto say that on his last HTML5 game _“I fought a lot with bad 
performances on mobile [and] here it just works like a charm! I didn’t have to 
fight with anything. I have a strong 60 fps on my iPhone4S and iPad3. Nothing to 
add. So kudo Bruno!”_.

[Michel][gh3] has released [hxsort] which is a bunch of sorting algorithms ported
from [sortvis.org] to Haxe. He has included two compilation flags which _can_ improve
performance on various platforms.

[HIDE] `0.3.8` has been released which are minor fixes and completion chaining. The
install missing feature which is coming soon in `0.3.9` looks extremely useful.

![hide 0.3.9](/img/198/hide.gif "Install missing feature | HIDE")

Also it seems the two developers originally working on [HIDE], [Boyan Ololoevich][tw3]
and [Pah Arif][tw4] have _parted ways_. 

Pah is now working on [Haxe Studio][l8]. Checkout his [explanation][l9] on what happened.

[Pah][tw4] has also released [haxe-printr][l10] which is an Haxe implementation of 
PHP's [printr], which I assume prints human readable information about a variable.

[Tong][gh4] has released [hxinotify] `1.1` which provides CPP and Neko binds to [inotify],
a inode based filesystem notification library for monitoring the filesystem.

[Peter Stefcek][tw5] has released the Haxe build `250` of [Genome2D]. Peter has also
committed a [Javascript context][l11] with examples coming soon.

[Eduardo Dias][tw6] has released directly to haxelib externs for NodeJS in the library 
[NodeHx]. Some classes are fully typed, some are dynamically typed.

[Dvergar][gh5] has created a [Pyxel Edit][l12] plugin, a [map importer] with an OpenFL
helper and plenty of examples in the github [README].

And to finish, [plenty] of games have been made using Haxe, OpenFL, HaxeFlixel,
HaxePunk, Flambe and other libraries for the recent LD29. Look out for a LD29 Haxe
roundup this Friday.

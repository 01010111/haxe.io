# Haxe Roundup № 206

Lets start off with an article written by [Lars Doucet][tw1] titled
[Dear Adobe: Support Haxe, save your Tools][a1]. With a great title, Lars goes into
how Adobe can profit big from depending on Haxe and all its awesome features and
name dropping big companies who already profit from using Haxe, TiVo, Nickelodeon, 
Disney, Toyota and more, articles like this help bring attention to Haxe, but 
with some [comments][l1] saying that associating with Flash is dragging down Haxe,
is it the correct type of attention that Haxe and the community needs?

Lars article has also [received][l2] [plenty][l5] of [positive][l6] [comments][l10]
and Lars is a great supporter of Haxe, the article just raises some interesting
thoughts.

Motion Twins have released their latest Haxe game [Uppercup Football][l7] to the
[Play Store][l3] and [AppStore][l4].

Another football game has also been released, World Cup Heroes available on
[BlackBerry][l8] and [Android][l9] devices.

[Ohmnivore][tw2] has created [HxCLAP] for use in a game he is making _“where the user
will be interacting with shells”_. HxCLAP is a port of [CLAP], a CPP command line
argument parser. I'm assuming this [demo][l11] that Ohmnivore [created][l12] uses 
HxCLAP.

[TiagoLr][tw3] has renamed Game Console to [DConsole]. DConsole is a real time console
that allows you to access, modify and monitor fields, profile in real time, evaluate
complex expressions and [loads more].

GoTo definition has landed in the SublimeText Haxe [bundle][l13] which was contributed
by [Dan Korostelev][gh1]. Just press `Ctrl+<` to goto definition.

[HIDE] this week has been getting a lot of positive praise, which
[Boyan Ololoevich][tw4] deserves for his hard work. [Jonas Nyström][g1] has 
[posted][l14] over on Google+ a screenshot of HIDE on Ubuntu looking sweet using
the metrodark theme.

The guys that make up the [Shark Punch][tw7] team who are working on The Masterplan have
just been [Greenlit][l16] on Steam!

I came across this article titled [Summary on the use of OpenFL engine][l15] which
describes OpenFL, the improvements that have been contributed by the author, _I think_,
and the current risks by using OpenFL.

[Ben Morris][tw5] has created and released [hxpk] which is a port of the libGDX
texture packer which packs image assets into texture atlases for efficient
rendering. Hxpk is a full port and includes all features of the original library.

Lets finish off with a demo of HaxeStudio `0.3.5` by [Pah Arif][tw6].

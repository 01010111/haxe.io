# Haxe Roundup № 212

[David Mouton][tw1] has written [Develop in Haxe with NPM][l1] in which he explains why
you might want to use NPM and Haxe, how to get setup and started, then taking it further
by configuring IntelliJ IDEA and Jenkins, an open source continuous integration server.

A conversation has popped up on the Haxe mailing list [discussing][l4] the official
position on supporting NodeJS. In the upcoming Haxe `3.2` release, but available from
[nightly][l5] builds now, the compiler team have added `@:jsRequire` which automatically
`require`'s an extern class, as well as other, non NodeJS specific features.

[David][tw1] also created a few months ago [Code Of War][l2] in which you create an
AI, using Haxe, JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart or CoffeeScript, with the provided 
[SDK][l3] to create a winning strategy which gets pitted against other user created AI's.

[Billy Spelchan][g+1] has written [Drone Defence Postmortem][l6] in which he explains
what went well, what threw a wrench into the works and what went wrong for his recent
[Drone Defence][l7] game created with OpenFL.

[Andreas Rønning][g+2] has written, once again a great overview, this time about using
[Abstracts in Haxe][l8].

[Reach3dx][tw2] have released another video showcasing some of their advanced rendering
effects.

[Ian Harrigan][gh1], author of [HaxeUI][l9], has pushed the first GUI for Haxelib
to [GitHub][l10]. Its an early preview with basic functionality, but future improvements
to HaxeUI will improve the Haxelib GUI. Head over to the [original post][l11] on the
Haxe mailing list to offer suggestions and feedback.

Bronko Blue The Kitten Copter, Lite by [Lars Quentmeier][tw3] and [Katja Krone][tw4]
has been published to the [Play Store][l12] and [iOS Store][l13].

[Boyan Ololoevich][tw5] has added Python, Java and C# compiler target support to
the IntelliJ IDEA Haxe plugin, with additional fixes to make it work with version 
`13.1`.

![haxe intellij](/img/212/intellij.png "Python, Java and C# support in IntelliJ IDEA")

[Jens Geyer][gh2] has been working on adding Haxe support into [Apache Thrift][l14],
a _“framework for scalable cross-language services development”_ with code generation
for _“C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript,
Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml, Delphi”_ and soon Haxe.

There has been another Haxe job listing on the Haxe mailing list, this time for a
[Haxe developer in Dubai / Middle East][l15].

And to finish how about another game video, this time of a Roguelike platformer
created by [Vitaliy][tw6].

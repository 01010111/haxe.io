# Haxe Roundup № 343

[Ian Harrigan][tw1] starts this weeks roundup off with a [Developer Spotlight][l1]
interview over on the OpenFL blog, talking about his himself and HaxeUI.

Ian continues to tease us [on Twitter][l2] with upcoming HaxeUI features, with 
the latest sneak peak  of a _“**very** preliminary proof of concept backend
using waxe and **wxWidgets**”_!

Even though waxe is incomplete, Ian has [stated][l3] that his _“background is in
C++, so [he] is going to give waxe the once over [and] make it [have] a fuller
API”_.

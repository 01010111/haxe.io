# Haxe Roundup № 343

[Ian Harrigan][tw1] starts this weeks roundup off with a [Developer Spotlight][l1]
interview over on the OpenFL blog, talking about his himself and HaxeUI.

Ian continues to tease us [on Twitter][l2] with upcoming HaxeUI features, with 
the latest sneak peak  of a _“**very** preliminary proof of concept backend
using waxe and **wxWidgets**”_!

Even though waxe is incomplete, Ian has [stated][l3] that his _“background is in
C++, so [he] is going to give waxe the once over [and] make it [have] a fuller
API”_.

The awesome [Andy Li][tw2] has spoken and promotoed Haxe at this years
[PyCON HK][tw3] conference and has made his talks slides and notes [available][l4]
to all. As usual, I've provided a [backup][l5].

Andy has also released some graphics built using Python based on the data he
collected from his Haxe usage survey, so have a [quick cheeky peak][l6].

[Tomas Slusny][tw4] continues to work on and improve [Raxe][l7], an alternative
sytax for Haxe, inspired by Ruby, by adding _“Scala like traits to Raxe”_, with
a [helpful example][l8].

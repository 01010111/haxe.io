# Haxe Roundup № 196

The Haxe Foundation have [released][link 1] Haxe version `3.1.3`. This release is
considered a bug fix release, but really its a sign of a closer community forming,
as this release fixes an incompatibility between the standard library
and OpenFL. 

Because of this, the Travis builds will be running compiler changes against
OpenFL, Flambe, Polygonal DS, MassiveUnit and other various libraries to detect any
breaking changes they might make. Checkout the full [changelog][change 1] for more
detailed information.

With a new Haxe release means a new HXCPP [release][link 2], version `3.1.3`. This 
release includes a revamped toolchain, which is still classed as a work in-progress,
so its undocumented. They have also added BlackBerry and Tizen binaries and improved
memory operations for `Arrays` and `haxe.io.Bytes`.

Also, awe6 version `2.3.642` has been [released][link 3], which again, mainly is a bug fix
release, with the exception of two new HTML5 drivers, the OpenFL-HTML5 driver, which is
based on Pixi.js and a CreateJS driver which is considered a more robust driver, which
performs as they expected.

[Eduardo Dias][tw 1], who is working on [Haxor][tw 2], has released an experimental
FlashDevelop [plugin][link 4] which provides GLSL completion, syntax colouring of
`.vs`, `.fs`, `.vert` and `.frag` files, references from OpenGL.org, with compiler
warnings showing up in the results panel.

[Tom Byrne][gh 1] has published a new library, [HaxeBridges], which is an experimental
library which provides discreet communication between Haxe targets by generating
asynchronous communication between targets, using Haxe macros to simplify the entire
process.

[Lubos Lenco][tw 3] has created and published a new WebGL demo using the Kha framework,
take a look at the [perlin noise shader][link 4] demo.

[Adrian][tw 5] has released [Saving Alley Cats!][link 11] built with HaxeFlixel, OpenFL and Haxe
to the [Google Play Store][link 11].

[Andreas Rønning][gh 2] has released [bmfonthx] which is a Haxe reader for the binary
[BMFont format][link 6]. Available from haxelib and it _“works a treat [with] OpenFL and
Lime OpenGL renderers”_.

[Andreas][gh 2] also triggered the age old [debate][link 7] about Haxe `for` loops.

And he also goes [onto write] about how _“absolutely delightful”_ its been to resume
working on Croissant Fighter by removing OpenFL from his engine and creating a
_“tighter binding to the underlying OpenGL, OpenAL and SDL2 Haxe bindings offered by
Lime”_. Its worth reading Andreas's opinion and the comments.

[Joshua Granick][gh 3] has written [changes in the Lime repository][link 8] which
states the recent changes to reintegrate with NME and HXCPP shouldn't change anything
for the end user, except for the improvements that are being made. If you're contributing
to Lime or OpenFL or building from source, you should probably check the post out.

Another article has appeared over on Tuts+, [Write Once, Publish Everywhere with HaxePunk:
Cross-Platform Tips][link 9]. Its great to see the various Haxe libraries get documented and
talked about.

[Onat Baş][tw 4] has released [AkaLoader] which is a external asset loading library
for OpenFL. [Onat][tw 4] has also written a quick introduction post [AkaLoader - 
External asset loading library for OpenFL][link 10].

And finally, [try.haxe.org] has been updated with function arg autocompletion!

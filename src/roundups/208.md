# Haxe Roundup № 208

There are two job offerings that have appeared this week. The first from
[Massive Interactive] who have the largest Haxe engineering team world wide, building
_“native TV applications across mobile, tablet, smart TV's and the latest game 
consoles”_.

The second is from [OCM] who are _“developing client side product customizer applications in
Haxe and are looking for freelance developers with experience in PHP to help with
integration into existing ecommerce platforms”_.

[Justin Donaldson][gh1] has created a proof of concept macro driven reactive template
system called [Flow]. Definitely checkout the [introduction][l1] post over on the mailing
list which links to the successor of Hxmr which was a macro based mxml replacement.

The [Half a Bench][tw8] duo Craig and Judith have released [81 Rock n Roll] to the 
[Play Store][l6] and many other stores, which was made with Haxe and OpenFL. Its 
an addictive game, checkout the trailer below.

[Boyan Ololoevich][tw7] has been busy getting HIDE working with Atom Shell instead
of Node Webkit, which now uses [node-pathwatcher] which has made HIDE alot faster.

[Laurent Bédubourg][tw1] has written [How to use LibGDX with Haxe][l2]. Laurent goes
into detail on what LibGDX is, how to setup your project structure, integrating with Gradle
and getting all this working together.

[Lubos Lenco][tw2] shows below that [Kha], an alternative to OpenFL, works on consoles,
and to the other end, smart watches, in this case Kha running on the Samsung Gear compiled down to WebGL.

[Peter Halacsy][tw6], CTO of [Prezi], the Haxe powered presentation software, has
written [How and why Prezi turned to JavaScript][l5] and _“why it took four years”_
to complete. Its a great read, try and make some time to read it.

[Michel Käser][tw3] has published a [sneak peak][l3] of [hxcurl] upcoming multi API.

[Mark Knol][tw4] has added trimming and multipacked spritesheet support to the Flambe
TexturePacker [library][l4] he has written, which was mentioned in lasts week [roundup].

[Mike Almond][tw5] has created [Monosynth] which is a Haxe Flambe audio experiment
which runs through WebGL and uses the web audio API. I had to pull myself away from it
to finish this roundup.

If you use OpenFL and HaxeFlixel to build native games and are targeting OSX, take
a look at [Jonathan's][tw9] post [Tip for faster HaxeFlixel and XCode builds][l7].

Heres a sneak peek of [Eric Bernier's][tw15] next HaxeFlixel game.

[Thomas Baudon][tw10] got inspired by Unreal Engines blueprint and has attempted to
make his own, embedded below. He has gotten _“some good results at the moment”_. You
can find the [source][l8] available on GitHub.

[TiagoLr][tw11] has created and released onto haxelib [async tests][l9] which _“
provides async unit tests by extending [the] Haxe standard unit test [library]”_. For 
a quick and easy introduction, head over to async tests [on github][l10].

[Ohmnivore][tw12] has started a [tigsource][l11] devlog for SkullRush, an online
multiplayer open source platform shooter. Its [powered][l12] by HaxeFlixel, HaxeNet,
MSignal and loads more Haxe libraries. The game itself is also open source under
`GPLv3`.

[Don't Move][l13], made with Haxe, OpenFL and HaxeFlixel and created by
[Steve Richey][tw13] _“is a game about ninjas, failure, ludonarrative dissonance,
and player investment manipulation”_ and is now on [Steam Greenlight][l14]!

[Pah Arif][tw14], author of the Haxe Studio IDE has created the first third party
plugin called Probe, which you can watch in action below.

And to finish off here is a video by [Steve Richey][tw14] of a game that
actually shows the code used to render it by using macros.

# Haxe Roundup № 208

There are two job offerings that have appeared this week. The first from
[Massive Interactive] who have the largest Haxe engineering team world wide, building
_“native TV applications across mobile, tablet, smart TV's and the latest game 
consoles”_.

The second is from [OCM] who are _“developing clientside product customizer applications in
Haxe and are looking for freelance developers with experience in PHP to help with
integration into existing ecommerce platforms”_.

[Justin Donaldson][gh1] has created a proof of concept macro driven reactive template
system called [Flow]. Definitly checkout the [introduction][l1] post over on the mailing
list which links to the successor of Hxmr which was a macro based mxml replacement.

[Boyan Ololoevich][tw7] has been busy getting HIDE working with Atom Shell instead
of Node Webkit, which now uses [node-pathwatcher] which has made HIDE alot faster.

[Laurent Bédubourg][tw1] has written [How to use LibGDX with Haxe][l2]. Laurent goes
into detail on what LibGDX is, how to setup your prject structure, intergrating with Gradle
and getting all this working together.

[Lubos Lenco][tw2] shows below that [Kha], an alternative to OpenFL, works on consoles
to smartwatches, in this case Kha running on the Samsung Gear compiled down to WebGL.

[Peter Halacsy][tw6], CTO of [Prezi] the Haxe powered presentation software, has
written [How and why Prezi turned to JavaScript][l5] and _“why it took four years”_
to complete. Its a great read, try and make some time to read it.

[Michel Käser][tw3] has published a [sneak peak][l3] of [hxcurl] upcoming multi API.

[Mark Knol][tw4] has added trimming and multipacked spritesheet support to the Flambe
TexturePacker [library][l4] he has written, which was mentioned in lasts week [roundup].

[Mike Almond][tw5] has created [Monosynth] which is a Haxe Flambe audio experiment
which runs through WebGL and uses the web audio API. I had to pull myself away to 
finish this roundup.

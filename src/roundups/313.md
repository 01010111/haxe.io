# Haxe Roundup № 313

I'll start off with a project from [Patrick Le Clec'h][tw1] that's picked my 
interest. Patrick has been releasing on twitter a bunch of expierimental
modificiations to the Haxe compiler which you can try out over on 
[hacking-haxe.atouchofcode.com][l1].

This last week Patrick has released:
	+ C like `for` [loops][l2].
	+ Short [Lambdas][l3].
	+ Binary and Octal [separators][l4].
	+ And finally [destructuring][l5].

[Franco Ponticelli][tw2] has created a GitHub repository called [gcodex][l6] which
helps build [GCode][l7] programmatically, primarily to control his home made 
[CNC][l8].

[Lars Doucet][tw3] has posted the image below on [twitter][l9] with _“This is why we
switched to Haxe for Defenders Quest 2 / DQ1HD”_.

[Nico][tw4] and [Compost Face][tw5] has started documenting their game Heavier than
Air over on [TIGSource][l10] posting some impressive art with afew mentions of [luxe
engine][l11]. Keep an eye on Nico's and Compost Face's twitter accounts for ingame
previews.

[Fuz][tw6] has been busy documenting his progress with Haxe.
	+ Game #1 [completed][l12].
	+ Game #2 [status][l13].
	+ Game #3 [video][l14].

[Sven Bergström][tw7] has posted over on the Snõwkit community site 
[Snõwkit Dev Log #2][l15]. Its a pretty long post touching on the current
[history rewrite][l16], a new _beautiful_ [continuous itergration][l17] service,
the awesome community work on the Atom.io [Haxe packages][l18] and plenty more,
especially the hints at a new, improved, unified way of working with 
native libraries.

[Adi Mora Reddy][tw8] has created an [alternative][l19] Atom.io Haxe theme, a 
light syntax theme.

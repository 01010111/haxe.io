# Haxe Roundup № 313

I'll start off with a project from [Patrick Le Clec'h][tw1] that's picked my 
interest. Patrick has been releasing on twitter a bunch of experimental
modifications to the Haxe compiler which you can try out over on 
[hacking-haxe.atouchofcode.com][l1].

This last week Patrick has released:
	+ C like `for` [loops][l2].
	+ Short [Lambdas][l3].
	+ Binary and Octal [separators][l4].
	+ And finally [destructuring][l5].
	
The WWX 2015 crowdfunding campaign has reached `218%`!

[Franco Ponticelli][tw2] has created a GitHub repository called [gcodex][l6] which
helps build [GCode][l7] programmatically, primarily to control his home made 
[CNC][l8].

[Lars Doucet][tw3] has posted the image below on [twitter][l9] with _“This is why we
switched to Haxe for Defenders Quest 2 / DQ1HD”_.

[Nico][tw4] and [Compost Face][tw5] has started documenting their game Heavier than
Air over on [TIGSource][l10] posting some impressive art with a few mentions of [luxe
engine][l11]. Keep an eye on Nico's and Compost Face's twitter accounts for ingame
previews.

[Fuz][tw6] has been busy documenting his progress with Haxe.
	+ Game #1 [completed][l12].
	+ Game #2 [status][l13].
	+ Game #3 [video][l14] which targets HTML5 using Away3D.

[Sven Bergström][tw7] has posted over on the Snõwkit community site 
[Snõwkit Dev Log #2][l15]. Its a pretty long post touching on the current
[history rewrite][l16], a new _beautiful_ [continuous integration][l17] service,
the awesome community work on the Atom.io [Haxe packages][l18] and plenty more,
especially the hints at a new, improved, unified way of working with 
native libraries.

[Adi Mora Reddy][tw8] has created an [alternative][l19] Atom.io Haxe theme, a 
light syntax theme.

If you are using the Snõwkit plugins for Sublime Text or Atom.io, head over to 
the community site for more details on recent [plugin updates][l22].

Recently [Kevin Purcell][tw9] gave an Introduction to Haxe talk, so while we wait
for the video to come online, you can checkout his [slides][l20] from the talk.
_You can also find Kevin's slides available on [Dropbox][l21]_.

The OpenFL team have [released][l23] Lime `2.3` and OpenFL `3.0.0 beta` which has
a handful of new features in regards to the recent Haxe `3.2.0-rc.2` release.

![openfl level editor](/img/313/level.png "Preview of a level editor created with OpenFL by @dmitryhryppa")

[Mike Almond][tw10] has created [Horizon][l24] which is an experiment using OpenFL.
Horizon is features a _“distant flock drifting over a slowly evolving seascape, 
accompanied by an abstract piano soundtrack”_. Try it out in your [browser][l25].

[Leong Wai Yin][tw11] has written the [tutorial][l26] Creating a simple button 
in HaxeFlixel. The article should be call _How to create a custom skinned button
in HaxeFlixel_. Just like his article from [last week][l27], the tutorial is well
documented with plenty of code and screenshots.

![tron tong gamma](/img/313/gamma.png "A first person sci-fi game by @disktree!")

[Eugene Veretennikov][tw12] has released a new version of [Tiny Planets][l28], 
which is _“now world wide [and] with Facebook support”_. The game is powered by
OpenFL and [StablexUI][l29].

I'm going to end this weeks roundup with the Red Block Attack trailer by 
[Beard Fish][tw13] built with HaxeFlixel.

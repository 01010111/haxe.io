# Haxe Roundup № 304

The last few days have seen three snõwkit articles released by [Sven Bergström][tw1].

The second focus sheet has been published [alpha-2.0+0010][l1] which will sort out
the asset management system and ensuring windowing events are consistent which will
result in some API behavioural changes. Sven also takes the time to talk about
some [recent updates][l2] and snowkit [related][l3] news. I'm particularly interested
in the native sdk based on what Sven has written.

>The native sdk is taking shape quite nicely, I have already used it to write some 
quick proof of concepts, for example in a very short time (~2 hours?) I was able to 
add clipboard copy paste, native window embedded (mac) Game Center, and load a custom 
native window directly from Xcode interface builder on Mac.

Sven has also [updated][l4] sublime_flow to support `hxml` files which now work just like
regular `flow` files.

The last article that Sven has written is [mint details: part 1][l5]. Mint is a
_“game focused, renderer agnostic, minimal UI library”_ which will allow any Haxe
framework to implement only the display portion of code, with native support for
responsive layouts using the [Cassowary][l6] constraint solving algorithm, the same
algorithm that Apple uses in Auto Layout. To reduce hard coding the constraints, Sven 
has created a new WIP file format called [.mint][l7] which is a distilled version
of CSS and HTML.

Quite a few videos and screenshots have appeared in past roundups of [Nico][tw5]'s
and [Compost Face][tw6]'s latest game, Heavier than Air, using luxe engine from
the snõwkit collective, they have created a [visual summary][l9] showcasing 
their progress.

A talk this Thursday 29th January in Boston, US by [Franco Ponticelli][tw4] on the topic of
[The Art of Transpiling][l8], with his talk called `Haxe - the King of Transpilers`.
Hopefully there will be a recording available at a later date.

A library that hasn't been mentioned in a long time is [Haxor Engine][tw2] which
_“combines the power of Haxe language and WebGL to allow the development of 
high quality 3D applications for the next generation browsers”_ will be focusing on
funding this year to make Haxor an official product, who are starting the year at 
[Campus Party Brazil][tw3].

[Half a Bench][gh1] have created externs for the [Pixi Particles][l10] library
which have been merged into the Haxe [PixiJS][l11] library maintained by
[Adi Reddy Mora][tw7] which resembles Particle Designer. There is even a [browser
based][l12] particle editor.

[Saumya][tw8] has written about his experience of creating his first CLI 
cross-platform [application][l13] compiled to Neko.

![openfl lime harfbuzz font typeface][/img/304/harfbuzz.png "@DanielUranga has Harfbuzz text for Arabic/Chinese/etc working in Lime/OpenFL!")

[Lars Doucet][tw9] tweeted a [picture][l14] of a green square that started a thread
which was about the attempt of getting Lime and OpenFL to work on the WiiU.

But while Lars fixed issues with OpenFL on WiiU, he released a massive update
to the HaxeFlixel UI [documentation][l15].

In the same week as Lars testing OpenFL on the WiiU, releasing a huge
improvement to the HaxeFlixel UI documentation and Daniel Uranga getting Harfbuzz
on OpenFL, [Jeff Ward][tw10] gets HxScout to profile [itself][l16]!

The HxScout profiling work, as far as I'm aware, is framework agnostic, so any
framework or library using HXCPP should be able to hook into the profiler.

[Erifdex][tw11] has written [A Revival][l17], a progress update on his game
[SwitchTile][l18] which is _“an innovative puzzle game, consisting of a grid of 
movable rows and columns of tiles. To solve SwitchTile, the original pattern 
of colours must be reached”_.

I'll finish this weeks day late roundup with the news that the core compiler team
are planning on setting up a [benchmark server][l19] to test and track the performance
of core classes, like `StringMap` between commits. This is only going to make Haxe
more amazing.

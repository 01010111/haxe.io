# Haxe Roundup № 304

The last few days have seen three snõwkit articles released by [Sven Bergström][tw1].

The second focus sheet has been published [alpha-2.0+0010][l1] which will sort out
the asset manangement system and ensuring windowing events are consisent which will
result in some API behavioural changes. Sven also takes the time to talk about
some [recent updates][l2] and snowkit [related][l3] news. I'm particurly interested
in the native sdk based on what Sven has written.

>The native sdk is taking shape quite nicely, I have already used it to write some 
quick proof of concepts, for example in a very short time (~2 hours?) I was able to 
add clipboard copy paste, native window embedded (mac) Game Center, and load a custom 
native window directly from Xcode interface builder on Mac.

Sven has also [updated][l4] sublime_flow to support `hxml` files which now work just like
regular `flow` files.

The last article that Sven has written is [mint details: part 1][l5]. Mint is a
_“game focused, renderer agnostic, minimal UI library”_ which will allow any Haxe
framework to implement only the display portion of code, with native support for
responsive layouts using the [Cassowary][l6] constraint solving algorithm, the same
alogrithm that Apple uses in Auto Layout. To reduce hard coding the contraints, Sven 
has created a new WIP file format called [.mint][l7] which is a distilled version
of CSS and HTML.

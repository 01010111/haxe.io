# Haxe Roundup № 202

Between the 23rd and 26th of May, last weekend, WWX 2014 took place with some impressive
talks and announcements. The easiest thing to notice is the [brand new][l1] haxe.org website.

The website was redesigned by [Jason O'Niel][tw1] using [Ufront][l2] a MVC web framework
using GitHub as the content database which is then pulled in, parsed and rendered to 
display the site. Every page has a `contribute` link which will take you to its
corresponding GitHub page so you can create/edit and send a pull request.

A dedicated roundup of WWX 2014 is in the works. There are a couple of presentation slides
still missing, so until they have been published here is a group photo of all the attendees.

[Eduardo Costa][bb1] has released three libraries while WWX 2014 was going on,
participating remotely. The first is [AndroidHx][l3] which helps ease and speed up 
development of Android apps while using Haxe. The second is [NodeHx][l4] which
provides strongly typed NodeJs extern definitions with documentation and the
third is [NodeWs][l5] which _“wraps the Http API of NodeJs and offers a straightforward
way to implement web services”_.

[Matt Tutlle][gh1] has created [HxLUA][l6] which as you might have guessed by the name,
allows you to _“run any Lua code inside Haxe”_ currently only on Neko and C++ targets. You
also have the option of passing a context object which will set variables before
any script is run.

[Boyan Ololoevich][tw2] has released HIDE `0.3.9` which is now available from haxelib.

[Alfred Dickson][gp1] has is [planning][l7] on releasing Zombie Delivery which is created
with Haxe and OpenFL in the next two or three weeks on to Google Play and the App Store.

[Dan Korostelev][gh2] has bundled up some of his gists into a GitHub repository called
[Haxe Thingies][l8] which contain several useful classes and macros that _should_
ease development. You get [DynamicObject][l9] which wraps Json or Javascript objects in
Map compatible object and [OptionalField][l10] which provides explicit syntax for 
working with optional and potentially missing fields in a convenient way. He plans
on adding more classes in the future.

[Vadim][gh3] has been working on hexagon tiles. He has
also added to [openfl-bitfive][l11] support for gradients and libSVG, and while he 
was bored he created something todo with fancy text!?

[Tong][gh6] has released [HxInotify][l12] `1.2` to haxelib. HxInotify is a library that
provides Neko and C++ bindings to inotify, an inode based filesystem notification
technology.

[Nico][tw3] has released [IceEntity][l13] `0.5.0`. This release comes with hscript
integration. Nico seems to be rapidly improving this library so you should keep an
eye on him for future updates.

[Ritalin][gh4] has a library on GitHub called [Haxe Should][l14] which is a constraint
based assertion library for Haxe.

[Chronosyndrome][tw4] has said he is porting an old AS3 library [as3gif][l15] to
Haxe. He has an early and slow Flash [demo][l16] available.

If you create or are planning on creating elearning apps with Haxe, 
[Knowledge Players][gh5] have released on GitHub [Scorm Extern][l17] which
allows your app to be installed on an [LMS][l18] easily.

Lets finish on a HaxeFlixel screenshot by [Nuno][tw5].

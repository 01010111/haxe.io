# Haxe Roundup № 221

OpenFL has received a lot of attention this last week with the news that Flash CC will
support custom platforms. Joshua Granick, lead maintainer of OpenFL, helped present 
the new feature at Adobe Max 2014 in [What's New and Upcoming in Flash Professional CC][l1]. 
You can skip to Joshua's OpenFL demo which starts at `25:36`.

Joshua has written [An Open Letter on the Future of Flash][l2] in which he goes into
much more detail how this is an important step for Haxe, OpenFL and which
affects other languages as well. 

[Lars Doucet][tw1] has written his opinions on Flash CC, Haxe and OpenFL in [Haxe/OpenFL will soon
be able to integrate with Flash CC IDE][l3] over on reddit.

That's not the only news about OpenFL, Joshua has released OpenFL `2.1`. It's not quite
OpenFL Next, as only the Flash and HTML5 platform targets are using the `next` codebase.
This release fixes bugs in the native codebase and hides native `next` behind the `-D next`
compile flag. The [OpenFL 2.1][l4] article explains how to update and install.

Because of the recent OpenFL news, Lars Doucet has outlined his 8 predictions for
[The Future of Flash, Mobile and Web Games][l5].

Lets continue with OpenFL love with the reddit post [Why I think Haxe/OpenFL is great
for indie dev's][l6], which pits Unity3D and OpenFL against each other in the 2D
arena. [Alexander Hohlov][tw2] has updated his [BitmapFont], which renders bitmap font's
on all OpenFL platform targets.

The OpenFL SnapSVG HTML5 backend has been updated to include the [HaxeUI] showcase
[demo][l7].

Unfortunately, I'll end this mini OpenFL roundup with the news that [Jacob Albano][tw3]
, whos been using OpenFL to create Iridescence has written [Framework struggles and
big changes][l8] in which Jacob is porting **away** from Haxe and OpenFL to Unity.

From OpenFL to HaxeFlixel, which is possibly the most successful Haxe framework
has a [beginners guide][l9] written by [Will Blanton][tw4]. The guide still has
two future articles waiting to be released.

Another site that has been pumping out HaxeFlixel tutorials is [haxecoder.com] by
[Kirill Poletaev][tw5]. Its insane at the amount of tutorials hes pushing out. His
[HaxeFlixel RPG] tutorials are already on part 6!

[Alexander][tw2] has recently update his fork of the Spriter [plugin][l10] for the
dev version of HaxeFlixel.

[Nico][tw9] and [Srulo][tw10] have published their game [3 Bit Zombies][l16] to 
Kongregate created with Haxe, OpenFL, HaxeFlixel and IceEntity.

Snõwkit, released last week, continues to have people experiment with it. [Jonathan][tw6]
has written [ColorRoll] tutorial over on the Snõwkit community blog, which builds
upon his [StarField] tutorial.

The community blog for [Snõwkit] is working out really well so far. You have 
the [Bunnymark Adventures][l11], [Flow, Luxe support on Vim][l12] and [Project Square][l13]
which are just a few of the recent posts in the last week.

[Tilman Schmidt][tw7] continues to improve on his demos from [last week] by 
[implementing][l14] wave drivers showing resonance and interference. [Christopher Jon][tw8]
has also posted a [demo][l15] of what he has achieved by messing around with snowkit.

[Khapunk], a port of HaxePunk, which is built on top of OpenFL, is being ported to
run on top of Kha. The author has published the post [Khapunk - Port of Haxepunk][l17]
to reddit, going into why hes doing this in the first place, what to expect, pros and
cons and the current status of the project.

If you've wanted to get started with Genome2D, but wanted a tutorial to follow,
[Marko Ristic][gh2] has [ported][l19] a _“mini space shooter game [which is]
based on an old Genome2D AS3 tutorial [and] rewritten in Haxe and updated to 
work with the latest version of Genome2D”_.

[Franco Ponticelli][tw11] has created a unified [home] for all of his, _awesome_,
`thx` libraries. His `thx` libraries aim to deliver _“consistency, customization, 
performance and extras”_ on top of the standard Haxe library.

[Jeff Ward][tw12] has started work on a proof of concept Adobe Scout alternative,
[HxScout]. Jeff has already started work on understanding what all the telemetry
data means.

[HaxeJS.com] has relaunch and rebranded as a Haxe AngularJS ecosystem hub, under
[Richard Shi's][gh1] guidance, with the aim for HaxeJS to _“help developers from 
all platforms build complex, high performance client apps for the modern web and
mobile devices”_.

[Michel Käser][tw13] has continued improving his refactored [hx-lib] library by
a bunch of classes which help simplify working with [bits] by using Abstracts which
build off the standard libraries `haxe.io.Bytes` class, so its completely 
cross-platform, checkout a quick [example][l18].

A small addition to the next release of Haxe, but instead of
`import path.to.Class in Alias;` [you can use][l20] 
`import path.to.Class as Alias;`.

Lets finish off with a video from [Alexander Gordeyko][tw14], in which he shows a
Haxe [program] control the Novation Launchpad, which uses his [pony] library.

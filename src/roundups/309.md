# Haxe Roundup № 309

![wwx 2015](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

[Slava Tretyak][tw1] has written [Fast Iterators for StringMap][l1] in which he
benchmarks the StringMap Iterator implementation from Haxe `3.1.3`, the Haxe 
GitHub repo and his own iterator implementation, all compiled to JavaScript running
on Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

[Sergio Barrio][tw2] has written his [final article][l2] for his HaxeFlixel tutorial 
series on creating your first 2D Shoot'em up. The entire tutorial source code is
available on [GitHub][l3]. Another great contribution to the community.

[Adrien Fischer][tw3] has posted a sneak peek of a tutorial he is working on, called
[Coloring][l4], a puzzle board game where you merge cards to unlock further colours.

[Lubos Lenco][tw4] has ported [Flump][l5], which _“exports Flash .fla's to GPU
friendly formats”_, from Flambe to Kha available from the aptly named [flump_kha][l6].

![zblend social kha](/img/309/zblend.jpg "Blender baked textures demo using Kha.")

Lubos also has released a new [demo][l7], I assume using his [ZBlend][l8] library,
which shows Blender baked textures in Kha.

The [Shiro Games][tw5] team have made Evoland available for Linux through [Steam][l9].
If you enjoyed Evoland you should probably keep an eye on [Evoland 2][l10], I really
like the quality art work on the dev blog.

And to finish this roundup off is [FireCHIP-8][l11] by [Ohminivore][l12]. FireCHIP-8
is a [CHIP-8][l13] emulator which abstracts the rendering engine but provides a
default OpenFL implementation. You can checkout the [demo][l14] which runs Pong.

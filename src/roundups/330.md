# Haxe Roundup № 330

The Silex Lab's team continues to steadily release WWX2015 recordings, with the
last week seeing three talks being posted.

- [Cross-platform game development with GameDuell DuellTool][l1] by Sven Otto and Rui Campos
- [Prospects for using Go libraries in Haxe][l2] by Elliott Stoneham
- [Haxe for the Web: Getting things done][l3] by Juraj Kirchheim
- [Isomorphic Haxe: Using Ufront to build apps for client & server side][l4] by Jason O`Neil
- [TiVo's Activity Haxelib][l5] by Todd Kulick

[Todd Kulick][tw1] has also published his slides from his [talk][l5] onto [GitHub][l6]
for you to read. With the video being published, the Activity GitHub [repository][l7]
has had its current status [defined][l8].

> Currently, the code in this repository completely implements an initial 
proposal API for the activity haxelib. The current implementation here is 
**single-threaded**.

> Here at TiVo we are currently working to complete and improve a newer 
implementation of the initial proposal API [...] this 
newer implementation currently requires additional non-blocking system level 
API which is **not** yet available from released versions 
of the Haxe standard library and Hxcpp compiler back-end. We are working to 
refine, complete and submit these additional APIs so that we may make the 
multi-threaded implementation here the default.

For me personally, the Activity library is one of the most exciting Haxe libraries
to be announced as it offers **so** much potential.

Another hugely impressive project is [hxScout][l9] by [Jeff Ward][tw2], who has setup
a [Patreon][l10] page, which is _already_ off to a great start, which was all
[Lars Doucet's][tw3] doing. Maybe the HF could back the project as well `;)`.

# Haxe Roundup № 330

The Silex Lab's team continues to steadily release WWX2015 recordings, with the
last week seeing three talks being posted.

- [Cross-platform game development with GameDuell DuellTool][l1] by Sven Otto and Rui Campos
- [Prospects for using Go libraries in Haxe][l2] by Elliott Stoneham
- [Haxe for the Web: Getting things done][l3] by Juraj Kirchheim
- [Isomorphic Haxe: Using Ufront to build apps for client & server side][l4] by Jason O`Neil
- [TiVo's Activity Haxelib][l5] by Todd Kulick

[Todd Kulick][tw1] has also published his slides from his [talk][l5] onto [GitHub][l6]
for you to read. With the video being published, the Activity GitHub [repository][l7]
has had its current status [defined][l8].

> Currently, the code in this repository completely implements an initial 
proposal API for the activity haxelib. The current implementation here is 
**single-threaded**.

> Here at TiVo we are currently working to complete and improve a newer 
implementation of the initial proposal API [...] this 
newer implementation currently requires additional non-blocking system level 
API which is **not** yet available from released versions 
of the Haxe standard library and Hxcpp compiler back-end. We are working to 
refine, complete and submit these additional APIs so that we may make the 
multi-threaded implementation here the default.

For me personally, the Activity library is one of the most exciting Haxe libraries
to be announced as it offers **so** much potential.

Another hugely impressive project is [hxScout][l9] by [Jeff Ward][tw2], who has setup
a [Patreon][l10] page, which is _already_ off to a great start, which was all
[Lars Doucet's][tw3] doing. Maybe the HF could back the project as well `;)`.

[Stefan Bachmann][tw4] has posted over on the [snõwkit][l11] community site the
article [Using HxScout with snow and luxe][l12] which shows a bare bones example of
gettings started with HxScout.

Another article from the snõwkit community is [Gif capturing][l13], a library which
adds the ability to capture in game/app footage, with the Gif quality being clear
and smooth. Great work by [Tilman Schmidt][tw5].

[Lars Doucet][tw3] has posted afew items this last week, the first of which is
him adding multi-monitor support to Lime, which was recently merged in the 
[master repo][l14].

![lime multi monitor](/img/330/multi-monitor.png "Lars Doucet's (@larsiusprime) multi-monitor Lime API")

Lars, who's part of the OpenFL's console team have also posted a video
showing OpenFL's bunnymark demo [working on the Xbox One][l15]. Also [Puzzl][tw6] 
have shown bunnymark [running on Playstation 4][l15]. But not content on getting 
Haxe **and** OpenFL working on two different consoles, they found time to get
HaxeFlixel's MODE demo working on the Playstation 4!

The team from Ipsilon Developments have [successfully tested Haxe and OpenFL
Pirate Pig][l16] demo working on the Android SmartWatch ZGPAX S8!

It's only a matter of time that a Haxe powered game takes advantage of the amazing
work going on to publish on all platforms/consoles at once. 

Motion Twins are already onto this, with their lastest game 
[RockFaller Journey][l17], deployed on Android, iOS and Flash and available from 
the [App Store][l18], the [Play Store][l19] and Amazon. Over on the [mailing list][l20]
David Elahee mentions the game is created with _“Haxe, AS3, hxsl, templo, 
dbadmin, h3d, neko, tora, redis [and] mongo”_.

[John Langewisch][tw8] has created [Swing Time][l21] using HaxeFlixel which he has
published to the App Store. In Swing Time _“you are just an innocent little girl, 
trying to enjoy her swing, but all the other kids in the park are trying to knock
you off!”_

[Anders Nissen][tw9] has released the trailer for his game Hexmage, a _“card board-
game hybrid”_ created with luxe, embedded below.

[Aymeric Lamboley][tw10] has written [v3.1.11 Libraries update and future!][l22]
over on the [Citrus Engine][tw11] blog in which he says...

> We won’t start from scratch for the Citrus JS… and at this time I can already 
tell you that it won’t use JS directly but Haxe! You get it, we will use Pixi.js 
for the rendering and a bunch of awesome libs for other parts.

It sounds like the Citrus Engine will be using the [Pixi.js Haxe type definitions][l23]
to power their JavaScript backend.

[Ohmnivoree][tw12] has created a _“shiny new interpreted scripting language for Haxe”_
called [ChopChop Script][l24], with the _“main idea to provide a scripting tool with
the best performance possible”_.

[Andy Li][tw13] has published [Including External JS libraries in Haxe output][l25]
in which Andy not only explains how a standard library macro works, but also improves
upon it making it _“useful if you use npm or bower to manage JS dependencies”_.

[Matthijs Kamstra][tw14] has written about a topic that caught his attention,
web scraping, and in his post he [quickly lists the Haxe libraries][l26] that might
be up for the job.

Continuing with the web related news, [TiagoLr][tw15] has created Haxe type definitions
for meteor.js which can be found on GitHub [hxmeteor repo][l27]. For those of you
who have _never_ heard of Meteor.js, it _“is a complete open source platform
for building web and mobile apps in pure JavaScript, [building] apps that are a 
delight to use, faster than you ever thought possible”_.

Back in [issue № 321][l28], [Nikolay Grebenshikov][tw16] posted a picture of
his students from Khakas state university presenting a Haxe UI chart project. 
That project is now complete, with the code now [open source][l30] and compatible with
[Jive][l29], a cross-platform UI framework. You can also [try out a live demo][l31]
showcasing the Jive chart component.

[Luca Mezzalira][tw17] continues to work on and improve [haxe-watchify][l32] by
recently adding [live reload support][l33] and also creating a [dedicated site][l34].

[David Mouton][tw18] has published [haxelib.js][l35] to `npm`, which
allows you _“to automatically publish Haxe libraries to NPM. It's written in 
Haxe and run as a command line with NodeJs. The server side is written in 
Haxe and published in PHP”_.

![pico8 lua](/img/330/pico.png "Vadim (@YellowAfterlife) compiling Haxe into compact c-like lua code for pico8.")

[Kristian Brodal][tw19] has written [Introducing hxbt][l35] a [behavior tree][l36]
library which _“is not dependent on any other library to function, so it should 
work with your preferred Haxe library, framework or engine”_.

In [lasts weeks roundup][l37], I mentioned that Jeremy is writing a new Haxe book
focused on game developement. [Sira Tama][tw20] has co-authored the Japanese book
[Haxe for Beginners][l38] which mainly focuses on the Flash and JavaScript targets
and OpenFL.

[PeyTy][tw21] has published over on the Haxe mailing list that he has been working
on [alternative Haxe compiler][l39] that will be written in Haxe. The source code
for the new compiler when ready will be pushed to the [Alt Haxe][l40] repository on
GitHub. PeyTy has [published][l41] some _possible_ differences in the alt compilers
syntax.

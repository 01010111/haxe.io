[Sven Bergström][tw1] has posted over on the snõwkit community site [Haxe 3.2.0
release window][l3] that its _“part of our responsibility as the community 
to help ensure that releases are stable and working as expected, so please 
report any issues you find”_.

The OpenFL team have [released][l4] the first OpenFL `v3` Beta!

> Lime 2 has been designed to be low-level and portable, supporting not only 
Flash, HTML5 and traditional native targets, but also home game console targets. 
[BunnyMark][l5] has already been ported for Wii U (using Lime), and additional
low-level features needed for OpenFL are forthcoming.
> 
> The new OpenFL now consists of 100% Haxe code. Not only is this super-portable, it 
has other benefits. Since we're all Haxe developers, the entire community can now 
make OpenFL stronger, even if it's just a small fix or addition. And now that 
there's only one OpenFL library to maintain, we have already seen huge boosts 
in development flow and improvements to existing features.

Head [over][l4] and read the article to find out more on Lime 2 and HTML5 as a
_first class citizen_.

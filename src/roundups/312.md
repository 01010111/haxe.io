# Haxe Roundup № 312 - 6 Years of Roundups!

Of course the biggest news this week is that Haxe `3.2.0-rc.2` has been _officially_ 
[released][l1] by the Haxe Foundation!

> This release introduces the new Python target which was developed by 
Heinz Hölzer and Dan Korostelev. As with any new target it should be 
considered to be in beta stage.

There will be a handful of [breaking][l2] changes when Haxe `3.2.0` is finally 
released, so you better check out what's [changed][l19] to just be safe.

This years WWX 2015 Haxe conference has successfully met its first tier and almost
its second with the campaign currently standing at `170%`!

[Sven Bergström][tw1] has posted over on the snõwkit community site [Haxe 3.2.0
release window][l3] that its _“part of our responsibility as the community 
to help ensure that releases are stable and working as expected, so please 
report any issues you find”_.

[Tilman Schmidt][tw2] is back experimenting with luxe engine creating _“a 
program that graphs parametric polar functions”_. Tilman has two [other][l6]
alternative parametric [equations][l7] to look at.

Friedrich from [Rat King Entertainment][tw7] has created [Loguerike][l12] using
luxe engine for 7DRL 2015.

The OpenFL team have [released][l4] the first OpenFL `v3` Beta!

![openfl 3](/img/312/openfl3architecture.png "OpenFL 3 Architecture")

> Lime 2 has been designed to be low-level and portable, supporting not only 
Flash, HTML5 and traditional native targets, but also home game console targets. 
[BunnyMark][l5] has already been ported for Wii U (using Lime), and additional
low-level features needed for OpenFL are forthcoming.
> 
> The new OpenFL now consists of 100% Haxe code. Not only is this super-portable, it 
has other benefits. Since we're all Haxe developers, the entire community can now 
make OpenFL stronger, even if it's just a small fix or addition. And now that 
there's only one OpenFL library to maintain, we have already seen huge boosts 
in development flow and improvements to existing features.

Head [over][l4] and read the article to find out more on Lime 2 and HTML5 as a
first class citizen.

[Kirill Poletaev][tw3] is back, not with a new Haxe [tutorial][l8], but a 
preview of his WIP bullet hell game created with OpenFL.

If you want a new tutorial, checkout [Leong Wai Yin's][tw4] tutorial on HaxeFlixel,
[Loading TMX Data][l9], its well documented with plenty of code and annotated screen
shots.

Two games recently released, one using OpenFL and the other using HaxeFlixel,
are [Mew Lines][l10] by [Xenodrool][tw5] and [Stack Pack][l11] by [Nikita][tw6], 
both available from the Google Play Store.

[Slava Tretyak][tw8] has written [Fast Iterating StringMap Part 2][l13] in
which he continues to investigate and research speed improvements for the 
JavaScript `StringMap` implementation. Slava has also updated his 
[Particle Emitter][l14] with a bunch of new features.

[Fuz][tw9] has been documenting his progress creating games with Haxe with his
first update on a game called [Trying to be cool][l15].

![cornerhouse scribbler machine social twitter](/img/312/scribbler.jpg "")

This last item is particularly awesome. [Dan Hett][tw10], Danny Blackman and
Daniel Hall of [Studio Audience][tw11] have built a Haxe powered machine for
CornerHouse called the CornerHouse Scribbler. Checkout the [article][l16] introducing
the CornerHouse Scribbler. 

You can send a message to the scribbler by sending a tweet to `#CornerHouseScribbler`. 
Also checkout the [Flickr Album][l17] for some decent pictures. Oh and 
the code powering the scribbler is [open source][l18]!

# Haxe Roundup № 320

The biggest news this week is that Haxe `3.2.0` has been officially released! This
release adds the Python target, an experimental static analyzer and afew breaking
changes which you can find out more about the [release notes][l1].

[Andy Li][tw5] has updated [Dash][l18], the API documentation browser for OSX, 
to support Haxe `3.2.0`.

I'm not sure if [SharkPunchHQ][tw1] still need help, but they posted over on the 
Haxe [mailing list][l2] that they are looking for a programmer to help track down
crash bugs for their game [The Masterplan][l3].

Recently the results for LD32 where released, with the *[top 3][l4]* rated games being
created with Haxe and FlashDevelop! The fact that the top three winning developers 
chose to use Haxe and FlashDevelop speaks volumes.

While mentioning FlashDevelop, [СлаваRa][tw2] has [posted][l5] on Twitter a teaser
showing postfix code completion for Haxe in FlashDevelop.

TiVo have also mentioned FlashDevelop and every other IDE that supports Haxe in their
massive [comparison of IDE choices for Haxe programmers][l6] Wikipedia article.

The GPU Fluid experiments [repository][l7] by [George Corney][gh1] is currently
the most starred Haxe repo which has been featured in an Engadget [article][l8]. 
George has ported the GPU Fluid simulator from using Lime to snõwkit.

[Anders Nissen][tw3] has created a [curated list][l9] of resources for the snõwkit
collective covering the more popular members of the collective, [flõw][l10], 
[snõw][l11] and [luxe][l12] with _plenty_ of game examples, LD31 and LD32 games using
snõwkit, as well as [mínt][l13] and [hxsw][l14].

[Sven Bergström][tw4] has posted over on the snõwkit community site a quick [article][l17]
which tells you the state of the snõwkit collective against Haxe `3.2.0`. _Basically_
everything is compatible with `3.1.3` and `3.2.0`. There is of course more info
than that in the post so its worth checking out.

The Westport Independent, created using luxe has a public alpha available for
[download][l15]. While its downloading check the [article][l16] from Motherboard, _Kill 
a Newspaper in This Censorship Game_. And then checkout the new trailer.

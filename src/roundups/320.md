# Haxe Roundup № 320

The biggest news this week is that Haxe `3.2.0` has been officially released! This
release adds the Python target, an experimental static analyzer and afew breaking
changes which you can find out more about the [release notes][l1].

I'm not sure if [SharkPunchHQ][tw1] still need help, but they posted over on the 
Haxe [mailing list][l2] that they are looking for a programmer to help track down
crash bugs for their game [The Masterplan][l3].

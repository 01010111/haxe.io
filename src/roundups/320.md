# Haxe Roundup № 320

The biggest news this week is that Haxe `3.2.0` has been officially released! This
release adds the Python target, an experimental static analyzer and afew breaking
changes which you can find out more about the [release notes][l1].

I'm not sure if [SharkPunchHQ][tw1] still need help, but they posted over on the 
Haxe [mailing list][l2] that they are looking for a programmer to help track down
crash bugs for their game [The Masterplan][l3].

Recently the results for LD32 where released, with the *[top 3][l4]* rated games being
created with Haxe and FlashDevelop! The fact that the top three winning developers 
chose to use Haxe and FlashDevelop speaks volumes.

While mentioning FlashDevelop, [СлаваRa][tw2] has [posted][l5] on Twitter a teaser
showing postfix code completion for Haxe in FlashDevelop.

TiVo have also mentioned FlashDevelop and every other IDE that supports Haxe in their
massive [comparison of IDE choices for Haxe programmers][l6] Wikipedia article.

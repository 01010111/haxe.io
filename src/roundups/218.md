# Haxe Roundup № 218

[Jeremy Sachs][tw1] ages ago released to GitHub [Golems], _“a macro-backed system 
for compiling and embedding workers into larger builds”_, which works on Flash,
JavaScript, Neko and C++ compile targets. Its now available from [haxelib][l1].

For those of you who can speak German, Haxe has been [featured][l2] in the magazine
Web and Mobile Developer October issue.

Haxe support for Apache Thrift has been submitted to the official Apache Thrift
repository thanks to the hard work of [Jens Geyer][gh1], who is the third biggest
contributor to the official Apache Thift repository.

[Khaled Garbaya][tw2] has written the article [Create a cross-platform command line
tool in Haxe][l3]. He guides you through an easy to understand tutorial 
targeting Neko, which should just work on any system target, being PHP, C#, Java or
even C++.

Over on Twitter, [Christer Kaitila][tw3] [shared][l4] the news that if you develop for 
Android and publish to the Google Play Store you will need, from September 30th 2014,
need to provide a physical address which will then be available on an apps page,
viewable by all users. Thats if it concerns you.

[Madhoe][gh2] has ported noisejs to Haxe as [noisehx] available on GitHub. Noisehx
_“is a teeny weeny library to generate Perlin noise”_.

This demo of a glitch effect was created by [Tilman Schmidt][tw4], who
ported his Unity3D shader to use as a full screen post processing effect in 
HaxeFlixel.

This WebGL [demo][l5], created by [George Corney][tw5], is an _“experiment coupling
a CPU-based rigid body simulation with a GPU-based fluid simulation in OpenGL ES”_
using Lime, [gltoolbox], _George's own collection of utilities_,
a fork of [Andreas Rønning's][gh3] [shaderblox], _a compile-time GLSL shader tool
for Haxe/Lime_ and of course Haxe. The [source][l6] is available on GitHub.

While on the topic of 3D, [Lubos Lenco][tw12] has ported the Oimo 3D physics engine
to [Haxe][l9] using the [as3hx] tool.

[Ludovic Bas][tw6] has launched a crowdfunding campaign on [Indiegogo] for 
[Graal Seeker](http://www.graalseeker.com), in which _“you are an unknown 
adventurer seeking for the Graal in medieval Britain during Saxon invasions”_.

[Nico][tw7] has released [IceEntity] version `1.3.0`, only available from GitHub.
Checkout the [changelog][l7] for all the new features.

Here is a preview of [Romain Lebon's][tw8] game using Haxe and OpenFL

![game preview](/img/218/preview.mp4 "Game Preview")

A library I wish I had found earlier, [Beluga] is a _“framework helping the 
creation of browser game websites. Based on Haxe technology, it allows any 
developer to define the environment of its project”_. Beluga provides solutions
for an account system, forum, guilds, market and more. Beluga currently on works
on PHP and Neko compile targets. Its definitely something to keep an eye on.

![babylonhx](/img/218/babylonjs.jpg "@seacloud9 working on BabylonHx")

[Boyan Ololoevich][tw9] has released [HIDE] version `0.4.7` to haxelib with
contributions from [Nick Holder][tw10]. HIDE now has Vim mode.

And to finish off, [Laurent Bédubourg][tw11] has written the article [Moving
Arduino with Haxe/JS][l8]. It's great to see Haxe used differently like this.

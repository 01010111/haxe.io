# Haxe Roundup № 192

A couple of weeks ago, Haxe `3.1.0` was released. Well, Haxe `3.1.1` ~~bugfix~~ release
has been made available for [download](http://haxe.org/download). Three new features have
made there way into this release, with the more notable being you can now embed unicode
values into your strings. `var unicode = "\u4DF1";` will return ![unicode inline skip-lb].
Checkout the [changelog][ch 1] for the full details.

But, in a recent [git commit] Haxe got even damn faster!

[Daniel Glazman][tw 1], a W3C CSS co-chairman has [just discovered] _"Haxe and HXCPP
and [is] totally blown away"_. He says _"this is what I have been dreaming of and I am going
to use it immediately"_.

I expect that Flambe recently adding support for [Firefox OS] helped get his attention. Not
only his attention but Mozilla's attention, as they have written the article [Flambe Provides
support for FireFox OS][article 1], which provides an in depth introduction to Haxe and Flambe,
also how to build a game to run on Firefox OS and further details into Flambe specifics.

But it wasn't just Flambe that recently added Firefox OS support, OpenFL has also added support
in `1.3.0`. In the OpenFL teams article [Flash and HTML5, Unicorns Exist!][article 2], they
announce a brand new HTML5 backend based around [pixi.js], which is a _"super fast 2D rendering
engine that uses WebGL which falls back to canvas"_.

In the testing they have exceeded pixi.js performance by 40% on some systems thanks to
Haxe's dead code elimination, with the [BunnyMark] sample only weighing in at `22kb` gzipped. They have
compiled [Nicolas Cannasse's][tw 2] Ludum Dare winning game [Evolution] using the new HTML5 backend.

But the OpenFL team haven't stopped there, they have teamed up with [SunGame Corp] to bring stereoscopic
3D to developers to quickly support glasses free 3D devices.

But if your haven't used OpenFL yet, or have only just discovered the Haxe ecosystem, then take a look
at the article [Getting started with Haxe, Lime and OpenFL][article 3] by [Premith][tw 3] who takes you 
through a quick overview, installation, the range of IDEs and writing your first Haxe program.

Or maybe you've heard of HaxeFlixel and want a tutorial, maybe a video tutorial, here, have [this video][vid 1]
tutorial recorded by [Christopher Bulter][tw 4]. Also check out [part 2][vid 2] and [part 3][vid 3].

Or maybe you want some proof of what HaxeFlixel can be used for? Theres the [showcase] with a great selection,
but the most recent example would be [Laza Knitez!!] deployed to OUYA, where you are _"4 ultra noble warriorz
from the techofuture"_.

[Lars Doucet][tw 12] has written the article [Flash is Dead, Long Live OpenFL!][article 4] in which he 
talks about the bad taste left by Adobe and how any proprietary program/language should be avoided, that
the future is only in open source technology with only one clear options, OpenFL. Lars has done a great job 
explaining the different layers available and the difference between the Haxe language targets and the OpenFL 
platform targets.

Lars has also done a great job in the last couple of days spreading the article across all the Flash forums and
received great feedback from the Flash community.

[Raphael Harmel][tw 5] has posted to the Haxe mailing list that two [round tables] are being organised for WWX2014
with the subjects being "Native platforms" and the "Haxion plan, the future".

[Hugh Sanderson][tw 6] posted to the [thread][round tables] the question of why not have Lime and OpenFL simply use NME `5.0.0` for
the native components, and replace the lime command line tools with NME and gives his answer to the question of _"why don't
[you] abandon NME and move [the development] to Lime and OpenFL"_. 

The thread is a great read, especially for those dependant on OpenFL, for those who started as an original NME user or 
anyone whos just a long time Haxe developer. You get the opinions from Motion-Twin developers to indie developers, with
the Haxe Foundation deciding to _"step in"_.

[Dan Korostelev][tw 7] has written the article [On my Haxe Coding Style][article 6]. The only part I can't get out of the
habit of doing to explicitly typing `public` or `private`. And I try to avoid skipping braces.

[HaxePunk][tw 8] `2.5.2` has been released! Checkout the [changelog][ch 2].

[Haxe UI] has released a brand new default theme, inspired by [feathers], the AS3 UI components library, which you can view
in the new [showcase][hui showcase]. You can also [try][try hui] building your own UI. Such a great website.

[Max][tw 9] has released [externs] for Howler.js, a cross browser HTML5 audio library.

[Michal Romecki][tw 10] has written the article [FBuilder: A tool to help work with multiple targets][article 5]. Instead of working
with multiple language or platform targets, it seems it helps you work with multiple command line tools cross-platform. Hopefully
Michal will write more about it.

And to finish up, [Clément Charmet][tw 11] has released another full stack Haxe/Node.js powered site [Danette Duels](http://duels.danette.fr/).

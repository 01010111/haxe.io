# Haxe Roundup â„– 193

[Papers, Please] has swept the IGF awards at GDC this year, winning 3 out of 8 categories,
 _Excellence in Narrative_, _Excellence in Design_ and the _Seumas McNally Grand Prize_!
Congratulations to [Lucas Pope][tw 1] for the great success.

[Lars Doucet][tw 2] has teamed up with [Robert Konrad][tw 3] to work on improving
OpenFL, with their attention currently on adding filters and shader support.

If you're interested in the native HXCPP debugger, [Damjan Cvetko][tw 4] has updated
the debugging [howto] guide. If you like what Damjan is doing, consider showing your
[support](http://zobo.github.io/flashdevelop/paypal.html), if possible.
	
[Cardinal Quest II] has been released on [iTunes][tune 1], which has been created with
OpenFL and HaxeFlixel. Its also been [Steam Greenlit][steam 1].

Reach3dx, a new game engine based on OpenFL, shown at GDC and created by Gamebase, 
has a dedicated [website][web 1] giving an overview of its features. At the bottom
of the page is a link to a [slideshow] of Reach3dx, showcasing its abilities cross-platform.
They use the Bullet physics engine and support Lua and Javascript as their scripting 
languages. Pricing will be available in April, with the HTML5 version apparently going to be free. 

Gamebase tools have been used by Ubisoft, EA, Bethesda Studio, Disney and more which
shows how mature Haxe and OpenFL are to them.

[Grapefrukt][tw 5] has linked to his fork of [Lucas Pope's][tw 1] [SteamWrap][g 1] OpenFL
native extension for the Steam API. Theres also a quick [example](https://github.com/grapefrukt/SteamWrap/blob/master/steamwrap/Test.hx)
on how to use it. Im surprised the OpenFL team don't have an official extension yet.

[Jordan Wambaugh][tw 6] has released [TJSON] `1.2.2`, the tolerant JSON parser/encoder,
which now encodes class instances and parses UTF8 correctly.

[Michal Romecki][tw 8] has written a new article [Templotar : CastleDB localization]
in which he shows you how to use [CastleDB] to parse templo templates into localised
files.

Oh, [look][genpy] whats making its way into the compiler, __the__ Python target!

And lastly, I love this [picture](https://twitter.com/maggintosh/status/448739520792788992/photo/1)
of _just another flash prototype_ by [Marco Dinges][tw 7] using Haxe and HaxeFlixel, I _think_.

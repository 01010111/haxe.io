# Haxe Roundup № 316

[Lars Doucet][tw1] has posted HaxeFlixel [bounties][l1] for several issues which
need fixing to make HaxeFlixel compatible with OpenFL Next. There are currently
only three items left to get HaxeFlixel up to date.

[Lubos Lenco][tw2] has released his ZBlend [demo][l2] showcasing advanced physic
shapes which utilises Haxe, Kha and Blender.

[Pete Shand][tw3] has created [haxe-starling][l3] which recently had initial HXCPP 
support added. Pete has written the article [Starling for Haxe][l4] which introduces
the alpha release which points out missing features and other general issues. Pete has
also included two demos, one compiled to the SWF target, the other to JavaScript.

[Patrick Le Clec'h][tw4] is back this week with more Hacking Haxe examples, showcasing
experimental features that could be added to the compiler.

+ Overridable Pseudo [Privates][l5]
+ Short Classes take [two][l6]
+ Typed [Tuples][l7]!

Also, [Fuz][tw5] is back this week as well, this time completing two games, [puzzle
blocks][l8] in less than 72 hours and [TNT Ghosts][l9], both using OpenFL. Each of
Fuz's articles has links to play his games.

The Haxe Sublime Text [Bundle][l10], maintained by [Clément Charmet][tw6], has received 
ton of new [features][l11] by [r3a1ay][gh1]. Thats a [couple][l12] of months worth
of work by r3a1ay!

[Alexander Kuzmenko][tw7] has released [HHP][l13] which stands for `Haxe Hypertext
Preprocessor`.

> HHP is a type-safe templating system for Haxe greatly inspired by PHP 
programming language templating possibilities. In PHP you can use plain PHP 
code inside of a template. This feature gives you unlimited control of template
logic. Thanks to macros we can do the same thing with Haxe, but with additional
error detection at compile time!

[Sebastiaan Moeys][tw8], the founder of Gamesys, has [posted][l15] that Gamesys are looking
for a Haxe developer in Amsterdam to potentially work on their brand [Poki][l14]
which _“currently reaches 30 million monthly unique users”_.

To finish this weeks roundup off, [AxG][tw9] has posted a video showcasing his
[PonyNode][l16] library by creating a guest book application.

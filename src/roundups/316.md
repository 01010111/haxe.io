# Haxe Roundup № 316

[Lars Doucet][tw1] has posted HaxeFlixel [bounties][l1] for several issues which
need fixing to make HaxeFlixel compatible with OpenFL Next. There are currently
only three items left to get HaxeFlixel up todate.

[Lubos Lenco][tw2] has released his ZBlend [demo][l2] showcasing advanced physic
shapes which utilises Haxe, Kha and Blender.

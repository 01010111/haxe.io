# Haxe Roundup № 316

[Lars Doucet][tw1] has posted HaxeFlixel [bounties][l1] for several issues which
need fixing to make HaxeFlixel compatible with OpenFL Next. There are currently
only three items left to get HaxeFlixel up todate.

[Lubos Lenco][tw2] has released his ZBlend [demo][l2] showcasing advanced physic
shapes which utilises Haxe, Kha and Blender.

[Pete Shand][tw3] has created [haxe-starling][l3] which recently had initial HXCPP 
support added. Pete has written the article [Starling for Haxe][l4] which introduces
the alpha release which points out missing features and other general issues. Pete has
also included two demos, one compiled to the SWF target, the other to JavaScript.

# Haxe Roundup № 317

[Jason O'Neil][tw1] has shared his startup [Today We Learned][l1] which _“is a 
website and app that guides teachers through a 60-second update, which 
empowers parents to start learning conversations at home with their children.

Research shows these conversations have a significant impact on student 
motivation, behaviour and learning.”_

Comments about Today We Learned can be found over on [Hacker News][l2], so go vote it
up and if you working in the education sector, consider sharing the site. Jason states
the service is free to schools [worldwide][l3].

Jason is largely responsible for the Haxe.org website, [ufront][l4] and helps with 
more Haxe server related topics/projects. I think its pretty safe to assume
that Today We Learned is powered by ufront.

No content on mentioning one startup, checkout [Haxor][l5], which I've mentioned
afew times in the roundups, has had a little article written about, [Introducing
the Brazilian startup, Haxor][l6].

# Haxe Roundup № 317

[Jason O'Neil][tw1] has shared his startup [Today We Learned][l1] which _“is a 
website and app that guides teachers through a 60-second update, which 
empowers parents to start learning conversations at home with their children.

Research shows these conversations have a significant impact on student 
motivation, behaviour and learning.”_

Comments about Today We Learned can be found over on [Hacker News][l2], so go vote it
up and if you working in the education sector, consider sharing the site. Jason states
the service is free to schools [worldwide][l3].

Jason is largely responsible for the Haxe.org website, [ufront][l4] and helps with 
more Haxe server related topics/projects. I think its pretty safe to assume
that Today We Learned is powered by ufront.

Not content on mentioning one startup, checkout [Haxor][l5] which I've mentioned
afew times in the roundups before, has had a little article written about it
titled [Introducing the Brazilian startup, Haxor][l6].

[Adam Le Doux][tw2] has written [Luxe Engine, Snowkit and Haxe (Oh My!)][l7] in which
he introduces luxe engine, snõwkit and Haxe, where it fits in the game engine 
spectrum and the potential Adam sees.

> It’s true that Unity has a good community with lots of tutorials and help 
websites. However, Snowkit has a different sort of community feel. It’s 
something more like a collaboration. I’m enjoying how welcoming and active it is. 
And I’m enjoying the small contributions (tiny bugfixes) I’ve been able to make.

The underlying sentiment from the above quote has been mentioned before in various
posts and tweets.

[Clément Charmet][tw3] shared a video, embedded below, of a project he created 
the decoder for with OpenFL called LogForData. _“The decoding of the content is 
made possible by linking up a cassette player to a computer connected to 
logfordata.net”_. This is one of the more odd, but awesomely interesting projects 
I've seen Haxe used for.

There has been a huge influx of HaxeLib releases and updates, largely because of
[Franco's][tw4] mass update of his [thx libraries][l8] and his other
projects [sui][l9], [minicanvas][l10], [dots][l11], and [abe][l12], which, _if you
havnt already_, you should definitaly check out.

The other HaxeLib releases this week are:
	
+ [Kha][l13], an _“ultra portable game/media-app framework”_.
+ [Hamcrest][l14], _“a library of Matchers (also known as constraints or 
predicates) allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively, to be used in 
other framework”_.
+ [dat.GUI][l15], _“Haxe extern for dat.GUI, a lightweight graphical user interface for changing variables in JavaScript”_.
+ [HxDOM][l16], _“a cross-platform implementation of the DOM. Built to reduce 
duplicate code across server and client”_.
+ [HowlerJS][l17], _“externs of HowlerJS v2.0.0-beta for Haxe - Audio library 
for the modern web”_.
+ [PixiJS][l18], _“externs of pixi.js v3 for Haxe - JavaScript 2D webGL 
renderer with canvas fallback”_.
+ [Starling][l19], a _“GPU powered 2D rendering engine which mimics the 
conventional Flash display list architecture”_.
+ [Akifox-AsyncHttp][l28], a _“The akifox-asynchttp class aims to 
provide an easy tool to manage HTTP Request in an pure Asynchronous way using 
multi-threading on available targets (Neko, CPP, Java), the flash.net.URLLoader 
on Flash target and haxe.Http on Javascript target”_.

There have also been afew new library releases onto GitHub:
	
+ The [Awesome Interactions][tw5] team have ported an AS3 state machine library to
Haxe. Take a look at their [article][l20] which explains some difference between the
two.
+ [Djoker Soft][tw6] has [ported][l21] Opensteer to Haxe and OpenFL. It allows you
to _“construct steering behaviors for autonomous characters in games and animation”_.

[Fuz's][tw7] Haxe game challenge has come to an end, with [challenge 9][l22] and
[challenge 10][l23] his final updates, which means he created [10 games in 33 days][l24].

With Fuz completing his game challenge, LudumDare 32 came and went over the weekend,
which resulted in the [Haxe LD32 Roundup][l25] being released, only because
[Fernando Serboncini][tw8] and [Sven Bergström][tw9] convinced me too.

The [Haxe LD32 Roundup][l25] includes games using pure Haxe, Heaps, Luxe Engine,
OpenFL, HaxeFlixel and Stenycl. If your game isnt on the list, you can add it
to the [todo list][l26].

[Aaron Styles][tw10] shows evidence how great Haxe, OpenFL and HaxeFlixel are, when
a _“12yo with little programming experience made this [game] in 2 days”_, which
is up on [kongregate][l27].

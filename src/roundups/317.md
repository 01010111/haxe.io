# Haxe Roundup № 317

[Jason O'Neil][tw1] has shared his startup [Today We Learned][l1] which _“is a 
website and app that guides teachers through a 60-second update, which 
empowers parents to start learning conversations at home with their children.

Research shows these conversations have a significant impact on student 
motivation, behaviour and learning.”_

Comments about Today We Learned can be found over on [Hacker News][l2], so go vote it
up and if you working in the education sector, consider sharing the site. Jason states
the service is free to schools [worldwide][l3].

Jason is largely responsible for the Haxe.org website, [ufront][l4] and helps with 
more Haxe server related topics/projects. I think its pretty safe to assume
that Today We Learned is powered by ufront.

Not content on mentioning one startup, checkout [Haxor][l5] which I've mentioned
afew times in the roundups before, has had a little article written about it
titled [Introducing the Brazilian startup, Haxor][l6].

[Adam Le Doux][tw2] has written [Luxe Engine, Snowkit and Haxe (Oh My!)][l7] in which
he introduces luxe engine, snõwkit and Haxe, where it fits in the game engine 
spectrum and the potential Adam sees.

> It’s true that Unity has a good community with lots of tutorials and help 
websites. However, Snowkit has a different sort of community feel. It’s 
something more like a collaboration. I’m enjoying how welcoming and active it is. 
And I’m enjoying the small contributions (tiny bugfixes) I’ve been able to make.

The underlying sentiment from the above quote has been mentioned before in various
posts and tweets.

[Clément Charmet][tw3] shared a video, embedded below, of a project he created 
the decoder for with OpenFL called LogForData. _“The decoding of the content is 
made possible by linking up a cassette player to a computer connected to 
logfordata.net”_. This is one of the more odd, but awesomely interesting projects 
I've seen Haxe used for.

# Haxe Roundup № 211

[Sys Tools][l1] by [Cauê Waneck][tw1], which is a fork of the Haxe 2 repository,
provides a crossplatform way to access low level systems APIS. [Cauê's][tw1] fork
provides `ndll` bindings compatible with Haxe 3+ and Neko 2+.

[Andreas][gh1] has created [Buddy][l2], _“your friendly BDD testing library in Haxe”_.
Buddy is inspired by [Jasmine][l3] a [BDD][l4] testing library for JavaScript and uses
[Promhx][l5] to implement async support. Its an interesting alternative testing library
available to Haxe.

As TiVo's _“Summer Update”_ rolls out, more and more people and sites are picking up on
the fact that TiVo now uses Haxe. Slash Gear have written [TiVo on Xbox One and Fire TV
possible after Adobe ousted][l6].

The [OpenFL][tw2] team have published [OpenFL Summer Development Update][l7] in which they
hint at some major changes coming to OpenFL, Lime and the introduction of Aether. These
changes seem to be happening because of the recent work on supporting consoles. I'm
being vague for a reason, go [read][l7] the article. These are really interesting changes.

[HxMath][l8], created by [tbrosman][gh2], is a _“game oriented math library using 
abstracts instead of classes”_. Being [Abstracts][l9] and using operator overloading 
means HxMath can provide auto casting between types and using Haxe's structural subtyping
which provides compatibility with existing libraries out of the box. HxMath also has
decent test coverage, with the 2D portion classed as stable.

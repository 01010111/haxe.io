# Haxe Roundup № 324

[Kha][l1] has continued to gain attention since WWX2015. [Dmitry Hryppa][tw1]
has been working on [collecting][l2] FPS data on BunnyMark implemented in OpenFL,
Kha, MonoGame, XNA and LibGDX. With help from [Robert Konrad][tw2], the creator of
Kha, Kha's results have jumped from 61K, 75k to 131k.

I was surprised by OpenFL aparantly only achieving 30k bunnies, so I quickly tested
the app provided in the document and achieved 101k on Win 7, i7 4790K, GTX970. I wasnt
able to achieve any sort of drastic improvement in any of the other apps.

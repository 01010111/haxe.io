# Haxe Roundup № 324

[Kha][l1] has continued to gain attention since WWX2015. [Dmitry Hryppa][tw1]
has been working on [collecting][l2] FPS data on BunnyMark implemented in OpenFL,
Kha, MonoGame, XNA and LibGDX. With help from [Robert Konrad][tw2], the creator of
Kha, Kha's results have jumped from 61K, 75k to 131k.

I was surprised by OpenFL aparantly only achieving 30k bunnies, so I quickly tested
the app provided in the document and achieved 101k on Win 7, i7 4790K, GTX970. I wasnt
able to achieve any sort of drastic improvement in any of the other apps.

Any way, enough benchmarketing.

[Lubos Lenco][tw3] has luanched [Learn 3D with Kha][l3], a place where you can learn
to use modern 3D cross-platform graphics API using Kha.

> If you have never heard of this Haxe Kha thing, know this - 
it allows you to do 3D graphics in the most portable and simplistic way, 
while still being as close to metal as possible.

From Kha to OpenFL, OpenFL `3.1.0` has officially been released! 

In the [article][l4] OpenFL 3.1 Bring on the Graphics, the OpenFL team talk about
the improvements made to the `Graphic` class in which the software renderer has 
been switch out in favor of hardware renderer. By using the [Cairo][l5] 2D library,
_also_ used by Webkit, Firefox and the abandoned Linux Flash Player, the OpenFL 
have been able to improve cross-platform rendering consistency. You can see the 
[improvements][l6] in the test repository.

[Federico Bricker][tw4] has released two native OpenFL extensions, the [first][l7]
is an extension which allows OpenFL apps to go into immersive mode on Android devices.
The [second][l8], with help from [Daniel Uranga][gh1], brings native Harfbuzz support
to Lime and NME allowing you to render **any** language text.

[Steve Richey][tw5] has ported Try Harder, by [Glitch Nap][tw6], to iOS using
HaxeFlixel and is now available from the [App Store][l9] for Adult Swim.

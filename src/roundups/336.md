# Haxe Roundup № 336

![hxscout 0.4.0 jeff ward social](/img/336/hxscout0.4.0.png "HxScout version 0.4.0 is live!")

[Jeff Ward][tw1] has released version `0.4.0` of [HxScout][l1], which is built with
the latest and greatest HXCPP to provide a faster app, new and improved File
dialogs, thanks to the recent release of [linc_dialogs][l2], and so 
[much more][l3]!

With Jeff's experience work with the HXCPP target, he has posted his knowledge of
working with async sockets over on [Stack Overflow][l4].

# Haxe Roundup № 336

![hxscout 0.4.0 jeff ward social](/img/336/hxscout0.4.0.png "HxScout version 0.4.0 is live!")

[Jeff Ward][tw1] has released version `0.4.0` of [HxScout][l1], which is built with
the latest and greatest HXCPP to provide a faster app, new and improved File
dialogs, thanks to the recent release of [linc_dialogs][l2], and so 
[much more][l3]!

With Jeff's experience work with the HXCPP target, he has posted his knowledge of
working with async sockets over on [Stack Overflow][l4].

[Tecteun][tw2] tweeted to me that [DASH PLAY][l5], _which he worked on_, has been
released to the public. DASH PLAY is a Haxe `3.1` library implementing a DASH
client for the JavaScript target. Wikipedia [explains what DASH is][l6]:
	
> **Dynamic Adaptive Streaming** over **HTTP** (DASH), also known as **MPEG-DASH**, 
is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that enables high quality streaming
of media content over the Internet delivered from conventional HTTP web servers.

Thats _pretty_ **damn** impressive.

[Nick][tw3] has created a [Compass][l8] [abstract type][l7], that can translate
between compass direction and degree measure, why not [try it out][l9]?

[Thomas Slusny][tw4] has created [raxe][l10], _currently_, a custom programming
language, _inspired by Ruby_, that **transpiles to** Haxe. Checkout Thomas's 
breif [introduction to Raxe][l11]

![raxe thomas slusny transpiler](/img/336/raxe.png "Example of Raxe, an alternative syntax for Haxe.")

While we are talking about Ruby, [Paul Fitzpatrick][gh1] has released version
`rb_v3.1.1_9` of his Ruby target, which is the _unofficial_ offical? Ruby 
target for Haxe, which supports Ruby `1.9.3p194` or greater.

[Sven Bergström][tw5] has published over on the snowkit community site
[dev log #7, **embers**][l12], which introduces a brand new, low level and miminal,
future focused renderer. It instantly reminded me of Kha's “generational” API.

Sven also [tweeted][l13] that [Jim Truher][tw6] has successfully gotten Haxe, HXCPP
and luxe engine working on the new Apple tvOS dev kit.

[Niall Weedon][tw7] recently updated his library [hxdecorate][l14] to now support 
the JavaScript, Python and C++ compiler targets.

[Matthijs Kamstra][tw8] released another weekly update to HaxeNode, a
compilation of tutorials and examples on how to use Haxe with NodeJS. [This week
he has added examples][l15] of how to used lowdb and HaxeLow.

[Midori Kocak][tw9] used Haxe and JavaScript to create a TodoMVC example app, 
[available from GitHub][l16], which you can also [try out online][l17]. 

[Pete Shand][tw9] updated his [Haxe Delay][l18] library by removing OpenFL
as a dependency, making it completely framework agnostic.

[Lars Doucet][tw9] has written [Where have all the Flash developers gone?][l19],
in which Lars highlights the three main areas Flash developers have been 
migrating too. 

Three impressive videos have been released this week onto YouTube:
	
1. Haxe and OpenFL [Octree ellipsoid collision response][l20] by [Djoker Soft][tw10]
2. Haxe and OpenFL [Octree ellipsoid collision response on terrain and mesh][l21] by Djoker Soft
3. Haxe and OpenFL PiratePig demo [running on a Raspberry Pi 2][l22] by [Patrick Gutlich][tw11]

# Haxe Roundup № 336

![hxscout 0.4.0 jeff ward social](/img/336/hxscout0.4.0.png "HxScout version 0.4.0 is live!")

[Jeff Ward][tw1] has released version `0.4.0` of [HxScout][l1], which is built with
the latest and greatest HXCPP to provide a faster app, new and improved File
dialogs, thanks to the recent release of [linc_dialogs][l2], and so 
[much more][l3]!

With Jeff's experience work with the HXCPP target, he has posted his knowledge of
working with async sockets over on [Stack Overflow][l4].

[Tecteun][tw2] tweeted to me that [DASH PLAY][l5], _which he worked on_, has been
released to the public. DASH PLAY is a Haxe `3.1` library implementing a DASH
client for the JavaScript target. Wikipedia [explains what DASH is][l6]:
	
> **Dynamic Adaptive Streaming** over **HTTP** (DASH), also known as **MPEG-DASH**, 
is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that enables high quality streaming
of media content over the Internet delivered from conventional HTTP web servers.

Thats _pretty_ **damn** impressive.

[Nick][tw3] has created a [Compass][l8] [abstract type][l7], that can translate
between compass direction and degree measure, why not [try it out][l9]?

[Thomas Slusny][tw4] has created [raxe][l10], _currently_, a custom programming
language, _inspired by Ruby_, that **transpiles to** Haxe. Checkout Thomas's 
breif [introduction to Raxe][l11]

![raxe thomas slusny transpiler](/img/336/raxe.png "Example of Raxe, an alternative syntax for Haxe.")

While we are talking about Ruby, [Paul Fitzpatrick][gh1] has released version
`rb_v3.1.1_9` of his Ruby target, which is the _unofficial_ offical? Ruby 
target for Haxe, which supports Ruby `1.9.3p194` or greater.

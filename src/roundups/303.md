# Haxe Roundup № 303

[HxLanguageServices][l1] is nothing but an amazingly ambitious project. [Carlos 
Ballesteros Velasco][gh1] describes HxLanguageServices over of the Haxe [mailing
list][l2] as a way to provide _“tooling for Haxe in order to be productive”_. As
a proof of what the library can do, Carlos has created a [demo][l3] IDE.

Here is Carlos's reasoning for creating HxLanguageServices, including some possible future projects.

> But what I really needed is a library that didn't depend on an specific IDE or an executable (to be able for example to run in a browser without a server involved as shown in the demo) and that way me or other people can create several projects: static analyzers, ides and so on in several non-desktop environments. Even dynarec/jitter on the fly in browser/mobile. (I had an idea several months ago to create a jitter that would target to the current target with a simple ast, generating js, php, python, native machine code in cpp, or bytecode in as3, c# and java).

The Haxe compiler itself has been receiving a few improvements and additions this last
week. [Bruno Garcia][gh2] has [improved][l4] the `js.html` externs by making them 
_“much more accurate and complete overall with lots of new modern web APIs and 
fixes”_ by using the WebIDL and parser maintained my Mozilla.

A new and [improved][l5], faster `StringMap` implementation has been added to Haxe,
contributed by [SmerkyG][gh3] which apparently results in a `3x` speed increase.

[Simn][gh4] has added a new, [unified][l6] XML parser which is more standard
compliant and on some platforms faster. This is before any
platform specific optimizations have been made, so it should only get better.

Some time ago, Google Analytics started tracking Haxe downloads. [Josefiene Pertosa][tw1]
[tweeted][l7] the first set of information for the last month, _“33.000 sessions, 
18.500 visitors last month. Haxe was downloaded 3.168 times and the strongest 
audiences were US followed by Russia”_.

And [Andy Li][tw2] also [tweeted][l8] that _“today, the Haxe repo has just 
reached the 10,000 commits milestone!”_

Last Tuesday Adobe had an online conference open to the public which focused on
custom platforms in Flash Professional CC. Checkout the [post][l9] by [Joseph
Labrecque for more non Haxe details.

Below is the video of [Joshua Granick's][tw3] OpenFL integration demo. You can
get the [OpenFL Plugin][l10] from GitHub.

Probably because of OpenFL's huge influence and successes, [Terry Cavanagh][tw4], 
creator of Super Hexagon and VVVVVV, has discovered how [awesome][l11] Haxe is.

A new tweening engine has been created for Haxe and OpenFL. [Matthijs Kamstra][tw5]
has written an introduction post titled [Tween Engine Go][l12] which gives you a
small taste of what it can do. You can find a lot more [information][l13] over on
GitHub.

[Ohmnivore][tw6] has written [Enabling FlashDevelop Debugger for OpenFL's][l14] 
Flash target. This is something ever AS3 developer migrating to OpenFL needs to know
about. You shouldn't be able to go as the post covers everything in depth.

This is something I will have to try, FlashDevelop can now be installed on Linux and
OSX via its CrossOver [installer][l15].

[Sven Bergström][tw7] has published [2015 and beyond][l16] over on snõwkit. Sven
introduces mínt, an in-progress _“a game focused, minimally pure renderer agnostic,
Haxe UI library”_. Sven also touches on progress being made on HXSW, delta and
the strong community growth snõwkit is seeing.

[Adi Reddy Mora][tw8] has written another concise [post][l17], this time covering 
Haxe's Getters and Setters, which can be confusing for people coming from other
languages.

[Saumya][tw9] writes about [Haxe and NodeJS][l18] in which Saumya guides you through
compiling and running Haxe generated JavaScript on NodeJS.

I'll finish off this roundup with a trailer from [Texelr][tw10] for their upcoming
game Dead Alliance, created with OpenFL and HaxeFlixel.

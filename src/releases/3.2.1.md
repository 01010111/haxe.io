# What's New in Haxe 3.2.1

The Haxe Foundation officially released [Haxe 3.2.1][l1] on 12th October 2015.
To read about all the fixes checkout the [Haxe 3.2.1][l1] release details.

## C# bugfixes

- The C# target now generates the correct syntax for parametrized interfaces, 
classes, typedefs and enums.
- Calling `Type.createEnum` with a `null` value no longer fails.

## C++ bugfixes

- The C++ target's `Reflect.setField` now correctly works on classes with no
member variables.
- Using `StringMap` and DCE now longer removes an internal private variable, breaking
C++ `StringMap` implementation.

## Java bugfixes

- The Java target will no longer generate empty classes by making sure all
properties in `java.lang.*` stubs are correctly marked as `@:extern`.

## C# and Java bugfixes

- Both targets now correctly handle parametrized constant values, eg `MyType<123>`.

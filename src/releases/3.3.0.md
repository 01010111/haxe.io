# What's New in Haxe 3.3.0 _RC1_?

The Haxe Foundation officially released [Haxe 3.3.0 `RC1`][l1] on 27th May 2016. Among the various
bug fixes and general improvements the following are, _in my opinion_, the most notable additions in Haxe
`3.3.0`.

## Lua Target

One of the two newest compiler targets is the Lua target by [Justin Donaldson](https://twitter.com/omgjjd),
who has written [Hello Lua!](http://haxe.org/blog/hello-lua?utm_source=haxe.io) over on the HF blog covering
getting setup, what Lua versions are supported and more.

You can read more about Justin's work on writing the Lua target in his recent [WWX 2016 Interview](https://haxe.io/wwx/2016/Justin-Donaldson/).

## HL Target

The mysterious [HL](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hl) target, the second newest compiler target, compiles to **C**
and to a brand new interpreter, both created by [Nicolas Cannasse](https://twitter.com/ncannasse).

The only thing that is _known_ is that Kha can compile and run [Tetris](https://twitter.com/robdangerous/status/719308046531502080) in HL.

## Cppast

Even though this is listed under `General improvements and optimizations`, [Hugh Sanderson](https://twitter.com/GameHaxe) has
**rewritten the entire backend** that generates CPP code, which is largely a cosmetic change. Any performance improvements will come from
Hugh's recent [release of HXCPP `3.3.46`](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/haxelang/2eZHfMERlmM/eFy9bxiDAQAJ) available now from HaxeLib, accompanied by
NME, AcadNME, GM2D and NME-ToolKit releases.

For more information on optimizations and performance improvements you'll have to wait until Hugh's WWX 2016 slides are available or the talk
is published online.

## `import.hx`

A brand new feature, also known as defaults, allows you to define `import`'s and `using`'s that get applied to all
modules inside your directory.

Thankfully, [Dan Korostelev](https://twitter.com/nadako) has written all about [`import.hx`](http://haxe.org/blog/importhx-intro?utm_source=haxe.io)
over on the HF blog.

## Abstract `@:resolve` & `@:op(a.b)`

Abstracts can now resolve dot access either at runtime, using the `@:resolve` meta or during the macro context with an operator overload
using `@:op(a.b)`. Compiling the following code to JavaScript.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/3a38fa5fc19d2a3ae6d06d9ec0899fbd.js?file=Main.hx"></script>

Results in the following output, _edited for brevity_.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/3a38fa5fc19d2a3ae6d06d9ec0899fbd.js?file=main.js#file-main-js-L2-L34"></script>

Pretty powerful.

## Abstracts `extern` & `@:native`

You can now use abstracts as externs. The HF unit test `Issue4862.hx` demonstrates this perfectly.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/fa4537fc859d4980317ebf74bbd20209.js"></script>

Using `@:native` metadata, the abstract is renamed to match the extern object and by using it as an `@:enum`
you gain all the pattern matching abilities but on a native type.

## The `is` Keyword

A brand new keyword has been added, `is`, used like `(expr is Type)`. _Currently_ this gets translated
to `Std.is(expr, Type)`. As far as I'm aware, this has been added as progress towards [Haxe `4.0`](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues/4684).

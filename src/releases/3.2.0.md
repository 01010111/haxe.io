# What's New in Haxe 3.2.0

The Haxe Foundation officially released Haxe 3.2.0 on Tuesday 12th May 2015.
To read about all the new features, fixes and [breaking changes][l9] checkout
the [Haxe 3.2.0-rc2][l1] and [Haxe 3.2.0][l2] release details.

[しょーへー90.9][tw1] has already written [New features of Haxe 3.2.0][l4][jp], so
I will be covering some of the same points.

## Haxe Standard Library

### Python Target

The newest addition to the list of Haxe targets is the Python target. The
compiler team still class it as a beta target, so if you run into any
problems file an [issue][l3].

### `Rest`, `EitherType`, `@:selfCall` & `@:callable`

To help improve the accuracy of external type definitions, the compiler team
have added `haxe.extern.Rest` and `haxe.extern.EitherType`. Note the `extern`
part of the package, these two types are only ever expected to be used
for [extern types][l5].

#### `haxe.extern.Rest`

Taking the extern file `python.lib.os.Path` as an example, its method [join][l6]
looks like `public static function join (path:String, paths:Rest<String>):String;`.
This allows you pass in an optional amount of arguments of type `String`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/4c0f847dbf454f4ba605.js"></script>

#### `haxe.extern.EitherType`

Lets take `js.html.Blob` as an example, its [constructor][l7] looks like
`function new( blobParts:Array<EitherType<ArrayBuffer, EitherType<ArrayBufferView, EitherType<Blob, String>>>>, ?options:BlobPropertyBag):Void;`.
This allows you to pass in an array containing any object thats is a `String`,
`js.html.ArrayBufferView`, `js.html.ArrayBuffer` or `js.html.Blob` type.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/588dee9226301e9f8ab1.js"></script>

#### `@:selfCall`

The `@:selfCall` compiler metadata gives you the ability to mark an extern
class construct and method which is translated into an object call. An
example should help clear up any confusion.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/a1fc270e84babb0af500.js"></script>


#### `@:callable`

The `@:callable` compiler metadata allows an abstract type to be executed
which will forward that call to its underlying type.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/a041c0b91cc8b0c3bb0c.js"></script>

If you tried to compile without the `@:callable` metadata you would get the
following error message `Function<Int -> Int> cannot be called`.

### New HTML JavaScript Externs

The JavaScript target has had its HTML extern types updated to use the latest
features of Haxe 3.2.0 using a brand new externs types [generator][l8] created
by [Bruno Garcia][gh1]. This is where some of the [breaking changes][l9] come
from.

### Typed Arrays

### `Context.addGlobalMetadata`

## Other

### New API site & template

## HXCPP

### CPPIA?

### Optimizations

## Lime

### Cairo Renderer

## OpenFL

### Cairo Renderer

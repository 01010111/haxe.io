# What's New in Haxe 3.2.0

The Haxe Foundation officially released [Haxe 3.2.0][l2] on Tuesday 12th May 2015.
To read about all the new features, fixes and [breaking changes][l9] checkout
the [Haxe 3.2.0-rc2][l1] and [Haxe 3.2.0][l2] release details.

[しょーへー90.9][tw1] has also written [New features of Haxe 3.2.0 [jp]][l4], so obviously a lot of the same points are covered.

## Haxe Standard Library

### Python Target

The newest addition to the list of Haxe targets is the Python target. The
compiler team still class it as a beta target, so if you run into any
problems file an [issue][l3].

Lets see a rather _trivial_ example.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/8eb8fad01a4361b9db79.js?file=Main.hx#file-main-hx-L6"></script>

Compiled with `haxe -python Main.py -main Main` will generate the following python.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/8eb8fad01a4361b9db79.js?file=Main.py"></script>

### Rest, EitherType, @:selfCall and @:callable

To help improve the accuracy of external type definitions, the compiler team have added two new types, `haxe.extern.Rest` and `haxe.extern.EitherType`, also two new compiler metadata, `@:selfCall` and `@:callable`.

Note the `extern` part of the packages, these two types are only ever expected to be used with [extern types][l5].

#### haxe.extern.Rest

Taking the extern file `python.lib.os.Path` as an example, its method [join][l6]
looks like the following. 

```
public static function join(path:String, paths:Rest<String>):String;
```

This allows you pass in an optional amount of arguments of type `String`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/4c0f847dbf454f4ba605.js"></script>

#### haxe.extern.EitherType

Lets take `js.html.Blob` as an example, its [constructor][l7], _on line 11_, looks like the following.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/123a543d44928b52197c.js"></script>

This allows you to pass in an array containing any object that is either a `String`,
`ArrayBufferView`, `ArrayBuffer` or `Blob` type.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/588dee9226301e9f8ab1.js"></script>

#### @:selfCall

The `@:selfCall` compiler metadata gives you the ability to tag an extern
class constructor and method which tells the compiler to translate it into an object call. The following example should help clear up any confusion.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/a1fc270e84babb0af500.js?file=Main.hx"></script>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/a1fc270e84babb0af500.js?file=build.hxml"></script>

Notice how the methods of `extern class A` and `extern class B` are generated differently.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/a1fc270e84babb0af500.js?file=Main.js"></script>

#### @:callable

The `@:callable` compiler metadata allows an [abstract type][l16] to be called,
which will forward that call to its underlying type. If you try to compile this without the `@:callable` metadata you will get the following error message `Function<Int -> Int> cannot be called`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/skial/a041c0b91cc8b0c3bb0c.js"></script>

### New HTML JavaScript Externs

The JavaScript target has had its HTML extern types updated to take advantage the latest features of Haxe 3.2.0 using a brand new externs types [generator][l8] created
by [Bruno Garcia][gh1]. This is where some of the [breaking changes][l9] come
from.

### Typed Arrays

Haxe 3.2.0 adds support for cross-platform typed arrays, which are not to be 
mistaken for JavaScripts [typed arrays][l10]. However, Haxe's typed arrays are _inspired_ by JavaScripts typed arrays. I'm making an assumption that any JavaScript
typed array [article][l15], tutorial or example _should_ translate with minimal changes.

### Compiler.addGlobalMetadata

For those of us who use macros, [Compiler.addGlobalMetadata][l11] allows you to attach metadata to **any** type or method that hasn't been processed by the compiler. This makes macros even more powerful.

### New API site & template

The Haxe API [site][l12] has been updated with an improved design and functionality
which is an enhanced version of the Flambe API [site][l13] and template. You can
get the latest code for [Dox][l14], the **official** Haxe API generator, from GitHub.
